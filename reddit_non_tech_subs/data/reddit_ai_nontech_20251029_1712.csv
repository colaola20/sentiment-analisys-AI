My husband is an amateur filmmaker and I often work with him as a writer. We're brainstorming a new film project at the moment - he came to me with a basic premise and he'd like to go in a direction rooted in a blend of Ruben Östlund and Lynch. The basic premise being a young socially awkward woman who comes into possession of a robot ""boyfriend"" who seems to fulfill all her needs at first but has a corrupting influence as she enjoys the power it gives her. Of course we don't want to rehash concepts that were already done well in films like Her or Stepford Wives (even if gender is being inverted). I thought focusing on the psychology and even existential issue of what it means to be human or intimate, and focusing on the human soul would be an interesting direction, at which point he said ""Lost Highway"". So we've been tossing around some ideas about how a Lynchian approach could elevate the concept - undermining self-identity and reality, dream logic, exploring fundamental human evil, the breakdown of one's sanity, circular / non-linear chronology, etc. What techniques / story elements would you consider ""Lynchian""? Have you ever consciously used them in your screenwriting? Any thoughts on how they could be employed in our story, or whether it's even a good idea to try?",0.062,0.835,0.103,0.8743,pos

We call the ship the Gift. It isn’t sentimental; it’s literal. A civilization is a long conversation, and at some point ours decided to send a present to the universe—an exquisitely-built box containing forests and lakes and children and arguments and the kind of music that makes old people cry for reasons they can’t explain. The bow on top is a star we built ourselves. It doesn’t complain much. ***Rigby*** explores what happens when the universal question; 'Are we alone?', is finally answered. # Details: * **Length:** \~50,000 words * **Genre:** Literary-leaning science fiction (think *Contact*, *Ray Bradbury*, or early *Ted Chiang*) * **Status:** Second draft, line-edited and ready for beta reading * **Tone:** Reflective, emotional, slightly surreal * **Focus for feedback:** Pacing, clarity, world-building integration, and emotional resonance * **Content warnings:** Mild language, existential themes, grief, isolation * **Timeline:** Hoping for feedback within 4–6 weeks, but flexible — quality over speed * **Exchange:** Happy to beta swap or offer a detailed critique in return # What I’m hoping to learn: * Which scenes linger after reading? * Are the emotional beats connecting? * Where does it drag or confuse? * Does the world feel consistent even when it bends?

writers,post,1oj5kll,,1761747024.0,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1oj5kll/critique_my_except_wip_scifi_story/,"Critique My Except - WIP SciFi Story **1. Sunset Five Miles High** There are a few times in life that offer the rare opportunity of an unobstructed perspective; being able to look back with gratitude at everything that has happened, while also looking forward at the future with acceptance. Like reaching the summit of a great mountain and being able to see the trail drop and meander on either side — at least that’s how I imagine it would be. I’ve never actually seen a mountain for myself, much less ever climb one. Like many others, I’ve spent the totality of my life within the city, specifically the lower three miles. The little I know of mountains, and every other aspect of life on earth, I’ve learned via hippocampus transmission in the library pods. That was before I was digitally exiled, before my synapse chip was removed. Many would reason that death would be an easier punishment, and at first I had accepted that logic with an unabated sense of despair. But then I learned what it meant to truly be alive; what life must have felt like all the thousands of years ago before humanity left earth. I have lived what can only be described as a true life, one that can only be experienced without a tether. It is with this knowledge, that I am able to face tomorrow with peace. For what is a true life, if it doesn’t end in a true death? The drawn out sunset warms my back as I sit atop the highest roof. At five miles above the surface of the ocean, the air is desperately thin and with each breath, the hairs in my nostrils momentarily freeze before thawing with the following exhale. The clouds never reach this high, they prefer to drift lazily halfway between myself and the garden rings. At this height, the neon glow of the under-city is nothing more than a soft glow in the fog. Soon the shadow of the horizon will finish its slow climb up the city, and I’ll be forced to take my writing inside. But for now I am content to feel the skin on my face go numb as I watch the stars grow in number in the blackening sky. I know it is unlikely at best, but the thought of my story being heard brings me hope. It’s a far fetched dream, but it’s just possible that my death tomorrow could be just the thing that saves humanity. **2. Beginnings** Any attempt to capture the entirety of a life on paper runs the risk of either being overburdened with superfluous detail, or being so barebones that every bit of nuance is lost. Both result in pages that are entirely unreadable. Since my desire is that the story of my life would inspire change, I must labor tirelessly and walk the razor thin line between the two options for failure. I was born in the year seventy three of the forty seventh century, Earth years that is. Which is, simply put, a mathematic approximation based on the gravitational time dilation, meaning if I could miraculously transport back to Earth I would be nearly three hundred years old at the time of writing this. But of course I can’t — no one can, which is why it baffles me that we still bother to use the Earth Standard Years system. Sure, it made sense when there was interstellar travel to and from the old planet, but that hasn’t been the case for nearly six hundred years. On planet Alpha Theta III, colloquially known as Hydrosphere, I’m fifty four. But I’m getting ahead of myself. My father was a nuclear thermal technician, and although he would often admit he was a glorified grease monkey, my mother would say he secretly liked how the title made him sound smarter than he probably was. My mother was a line cook for the same company, Interplanetary Humanity Corp. As with many of the labor divisions within the IHG, their days were long and filled with the type of work that makes muscles taught and bones ache. But despite this, my early years were in a home of joy, often filled with my father’s baritone singing accompanied by my mother softly humming a harmony. All these years later I can still hear my father’s voice when he would tell me about the day he fell in love. “It was the grayest of days and the fog was so thick it felt like walking through a curtain of water, but when I saw your mother it was like the sky was rent in two and the warmth of the sun came just for me. Her smile shone like the full moons, and her eyes twinkled more than the Epsilon Galaxy. In that moment time stood still.” “You’re just saying that because I gave you a double portion of breakfast after you sweet talked your way past my better judgement.” My mother interrupted. “You were the one with the ladle, you can’t blame a man for trying.” “I most certainly can! It was my first day, I wound up having extra cleaning duties for the whole month.” She retorted and feigned annoyance. “It was all part of my plan, how could you ignore the charming young man who then offered to help clean every night.” My father smiled and winked at her. “You’re slimier than can of sardines.” “But you love me for it.” Those early years of my life were certainly some of the best, looking back I can say with certainty that I had something that most children in the IHC labor housing district never got to experience: two parents that loved each other fiercely, and loved me unconditionally. That’s not to say that life was always easy, even as a young child I could see that it wasn’t. There seemed to always be unscheduled maintenance of a cooling unit or pump facility that needed immediate attention. And all too often my parents would return home late in the evening, exhausted to the point of near collapse. I can still clearly see my father coming home and choosing to sleep still wearing his led lined work cap. At the time I didn’t think much of it, I just figured it was comfortable. Now I can see it was the only way to keep the tether completely silent at night. For me, those early years were spent mostly alone. Six days a week I sat on the floor and watched the IHC sponsored hologram of an artificial teacher intelligence. It was lonely, but effective, and should be no surprise that most children found that the natural course of their education found them prepared to enter the workforce by age fifteen. An IHC job was eager waiting, of course. Despite the hardships of life, in my early childhood I grew up knowing love and joy in abundance. But as the Old Earth saying goes, ‘this too shall pass,’ and it certainly did. **3. Oranges** It was the morning of my eight birthday, which that year happened to fall on the one day of the week that my father didn’t go into work. As it was with most of the early mornings, the air was thick and heavy with fog. We donned our IHC branded neoprene jackets and pants, and with a final hug and wave to my mother, we left the flat for the blanketed silence of the morning fog. Like any young child on their birthday with a promise of a surprise, I was overflowing with excitement. It took all of my control to remain silent as we wove our way through the tight alleyways. Six months ago my father made me a promise, if I could make it until my birthday without getting sent home from school, he would have a big surprise for me. You see, the issue was that this was my first time going to school in an actual building — and I hated every second of it. It was hot and stuffy, and packed full with more people than I had ever seen. It was also the first time I had learned how mean other kids could be. There was a group of four brothers, all within three years of me, who would make it a game to see who could make me angry the fastest. The teasing would never stop, and as such, I spent many days learning from the virtual teacher. But with the promise of a surprise, I had held my tongue and temper for the longest six months of my eight year old life. We rounded one final corner and could now just make out the glow from the neon signs lining either side of the wide road. The metal grated road vibrated slightly under my boots, and my breath made small wisps of steam that quickly became lost amongst the fog. “Phoros, do you know why the lower three are covered in fog each morning?” My father asked me. “The city lowers to water the gardens during the night.” I replied, it was one of the lessons that I had actually found interesting. “Good, but tell me more. Do you know how it lowers?” This went well beyond anything that had been covered in my lessons so far. But as my father had suggested, I had made a habit of watching the older kid’s instruction on the other side of the room when I became bored with my own. As we waited for the door to the elevator to open, I closed my eyes and tried to picture the holo screen. “The hot tank keeps the city floating.” I said confidently, then paused to form the next thought. “During the night the city must release some of the heat to water the garden.” My father smiled and patted the top of my head. “Well done. It’s a little bit more complicated than that though. The generators produce a lot of extra heat, which we put in the hot tanks to keep us floating. But at night, the city doesn’t need as much power since most people are sleeping. That gives the generators a break, and the hot tanks start to cool.” He stopped talking to make sure I was understanding. “So instead of running the generators just to produce heat, the city dips further into the atmosphere and waters the gardens.” He finished. The elevator door opened and we stepped inside. My father told me which button to push, and I pushed it with the enthusiasm only an eight year old could have. “But where does the generators get the heat from?” I asked. “Ask it again, correctly this time.” “Where \*do\* the generators get the heat from?” It always frustrated me when he corrected me like that. He knew what I was trying to say, none of my other friends got corrected by their parents like that. “The generators get their heat from nuclear fission. But that’s a lesson for another day.” We travelled four floors higher before the doors opened and three other men stepped in. Their clothes were stained and they smelled like oil. One of the men held his hand against the security panel, which glowed while it scanned his palm before flashing a green checkmark in the corner. After selecting one of the two floors requiring security clearance, the man turned and greeted my father with a nod. ""Awfully early to be heading to the Grand Bazaar.” “It certainly would be. We’re heading topside.” My father replied. I had only been topside once before, and it was years ago so I barely remembered it. Now that I knew we were going again, I couldn’t help the excitement from growing within my little eight year old body. My father saw my wide eyes and gave me a wink. Five floors later, the elevator dinged and lurched to a stop. A pair of women stepped on, filling the elevator to shoulder to shoulder capacity. They were older than myself but far younger than my father who had grey hair beginning to climb up his sideburns. The woman on the right was about to select the second button on the final row, but stopped when she saw it was already glowing. She turned to me and waved while smiling with teeth that shone against her dark red lipstick. “\\\`Morning ladies.” The man to my right, who smelled of oil said, while lifting his cap slightly. “Oh drop the formalities Bennett, we all know the level of familiarity we share.” I could see that Bennett blushed, although at the time I didn’t know why. “Like I said to these gentlemen, it’s awfully early to be heading to the Grand Bazaar, shops won’t be open for another few hours.” The man who had nodded to my father said. When he talked he had a habit of scrunching his eyebrows together until they formed a single line. It reminded me of my father’s mustache. The woman waved her hand as if she were shooing away a moth. “Yes, yes. We’re going on business.” “We’ve been hired for a month long cruise. Our patron is from the upper fifth. Can you believe it? They’ve even sent for us to be fitted for custom garments.” The second woman said, interrupting the first. The man’s eyebrows remained touching as he sought for words. It reminded me of how some of my classmates looked when they were asked a question they didn’t know. “It appears that our patron has very specific tastes that require something a little more unique than our normal \*work outfit.\*” The first woman finished saying. Bennett blushed again right as the elevator slowed. Once it dinged, and the doors opened, the women departed. We followed, exiting the elevator and entering into the Grand Bazaar. It beautiful and full of magic in my childhood mind in ways that can only be replicated by the stars of the galaxy. Neon lights shone through the morning fog as we walked through the wide street. “Father, why isn’t there any wind here?” “Good question, why do you think?” I wasn’t in the mood for any more thinking or pondering. It was still the early morning and I was tired. “I don’t know, I guess that’s just the way IHC wanted it to be.” I responded curtly. My father chuckled, hearing his own answer for questions when he was too exhausted to explain. “Exactly, sometimes there aren’t clear answers to things.” At the time, his response did nothing more than briefly fan the sparks of a foul mood, and being the perceptive father he was, he quickly diverted my attention back to the surprise birthday adventure at hand. But in the sobering acceptance of lost opportunities that hindsight often requires, I find myself deeply wishing that I could go back and ask my father what caused him to think that way. As I write this, I know — or at least I have my suspicions, so I suppose what I would wish for most, would be the opportunity to tell him that it will all be okay. That I love him. And that I understand. —————————— At the center of the Grand Bazaar stood the IHC speed tube. It rose from floor to ceiling and was almost completely covered in LCD screens that must have been at least twenty feet high. In the still dim bazaar, the tower shone bright enough to make me squint my eyes. As we continued to approach, a larger than life woman faded onto the screen. In a somber yet calm tone she began describing some event that I was unaware of. She mostly used words that were bigger than I knew. “It is with IHC’s deepest condolences that we inform our family, friends, and coworkers of the tragic event that unfolded yesterday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, surface probe alpha lost structural rigidity. The six IHC workers experienced a painless departure…” The voice in the speakers faded into the background as we entered through the automatic sliding doors. “What is she talking about? What does ‘unforeseen circumstances’ mean?” I asked as my father took my hands and pulled me into a brisk walk. “I’ll tell you when you’re older.” My father replied, his eyes were sweating again. “But today’s my birthday, I am older.” “I suppose you are.” He smiled at me, and blinked his eyes a few times. “But what the woman on the screen is talking about isn’t something fit for a birthday. Come on, we need to get our tickets.” I had almost forgotten, we were heading topside. The automated ticketing booth scanned my face and processed for a few seconds before showing a green check. A few moments later we were seated in a near empty transport tube. “Why didn’t it scan your face?” “It doesn’t need to, it scanned my access token when we walked through the door.” “Oh, and your access token is in your head?” “Exactly, it’s like a fingerprint, but for each synapse chip. It’s the same thing that allows your mother to pay for our food for the week.” Before I could respond, a friendly voice came over the speakers. It thanked us for choosing the IHC Expressway Tube, and then told us to remain seated for the duration of the ascent. “Remember, clench your stomach when we accelerate.” My father said. I hardly heard him over the excitement in my own mind. When the tube started rising I felt my stomach sink towards my seat. As we picked up more speed my head began to grow heavy and it was hard to keep my eyes open. The sensation only lasted a few seconds though before we were traveling at a constant speed. By the time I was growing bored, likely only a minute or so, the tube began to slow. I moved my arms in front of me and laughed at the few moments of near weightlessness as it felt like my butt was lifting off the chair and my arms felt lighter than a feather. Once we were stationary, the curved door dinged and slid into the recess in the tube. I held my breath as the light poured in. I knew I had seen it once before, but that was when I was much younger. Now having just turned a year older, I gazed upon the beauty of the topside with a new sense of appreciation. If The Lowers was like night, Topside was day in all of its brilliance. We exited the tube, and walked out into the sprawling courtyard. The air felt light and was surprisingly crisp and chilly. Despite the warmth of the sun, I found myself shivering while my breath made little puffs of clouds. “Come on, it will be warmer in the gardens.” With wide eyes and braille bumps on my arms, I followed my father onto the moving sidewalk. We walked towards the first green ring as the world around us sped past as if we were running; vibrant hues of the softest of greens became a blur and the cool air became wind against my face. The colors here were gentle, like a soft pillow. For those who have lived their life exclusively in the Lowers or Topside, it’s hard to find words to express the contrast in ways that would allow you to understand the depth of differences. It’s not as simple as ‘Lowers is poor, Topside is rich’ which is true in all meanings, but fails to include the nuance required. And to simply say that Lowers is dark, and Topside is light fails to account for all the other senses. Lowers is best described as the contents underneath a kitchen sink, crammed and overlapping, and with the constant noise echoing from the underside of the divider. While topside is best described as a lily being gently brushed by the wind; peaceful, serine, and joy inducing. The difference caused my eyes and mind to squint from shock. I lurched forward as my first step off the moving sidewalk caught all the momentum of my eight year old body. At this point my teeth were chattering as my father lifted me into his arms and carried me the remaining brisk walk to the garden. The entrance was a tunnel of sorts, with a door on both ends. I had expected to see another face scanner, but there was none and the door rotated open as we approached. Inside the tube was plain and boring, with reminders written on the inside stating that charges get automatically deducted once something has been picked. That was followed by smaller writing saying something along the lines of contacting customer assistance for any disputes — I didn’t finish sorting through the meaning because once the outer door closed behind us, a bell chimed and the air began to cycle. The warm and humid air descended like a blanket as the cold air fled through vents in the floor. My father lowered me from his arms, back on my feet, and rubbed his hands against my arms to chase away the final remnants of chill. The inner door opened once the air cycle had completed, and what lay beyond was better than I could have possibly hoped for. As I later learned in school, one of the many benefits of a climate controlled greenhouse is the ability to maintain perpetual growing seasons. But for an eight year old on his birthday, the garden in full bloom with every type of fruit imaginable was simply magic that had been worked just for me. The air smelled sweet and felt thick from all the colors. Red, blue, green, purple, and yellow were represented without reserve. “Pick your favorite, and we’ll try it together.” My father told me as he took my hand and led me along the sidewalk that meandered through the beauty. How was I supposed to pick? There were countless fruits that I didn’t know the names of, and some even that I had never even seen a photo of, much less with my own eyes. How was I possibly going to pick a favorite when I had never tasted a real piece of fruit in my life? That was the question that had been rattling around in my head, but upon seeing their beauty, it was a question no longer. They were larger than both my fists put together, and shone with an orange glow that seemed brighter than the sun. My father lifted me into the air so I could pull one from the tree. It was far heavier than I had expected and I held it tightly as not to let it drop and escape. “Oh please can we get two? We can take them back and share with Mom. It will help her feel better, I know if I was sick it would make me feel better.” My father smiled at me and lifted me to pick another. —————————— That night as I lay in bed daydreaming of eating another orange and waiting for sleep to come, I overheard one of the few times my parents argued. “It was expensive enough to even go topside. We can’t afford two, you know that.” “I know my love, but you should have seen his face. How was I supposed to tell him no? He asked for a second one because he wanted to share it with you.” “You’ve already said that, but how are we going to pay for it?” “The reactor cleanup team has a temporary spot opening after the mantel accident. I’ll pick up a few extra shifts until it’s covered. I’ll figure it out, trust me.” My mother sighed. “I know you will, you always do. I just don’t have much time left and I don’t want you to spend it working extra so I can have a bite of fruit.” As I lay in bed and tried to understand what my mother had meant I could just faintly hear the sound of crying. I couldn’t tell if it was my father or mother.",0.05,0.813,0.138,0.9999,pos

I need help writing a synopsis and blurb. To be honest im not even sure what the difference is, I think blurbs are To aid me in this endeavor, here is a full breakdown of book 1 plot and its characters and setting Title: Inventory Mage Traditional LitRPG, equalparts Scifi and Fantasy, Magitech stuff. Overpowered MC if he uses his brain to leverage advantages, not just raw strength. Danny Lastname and his brother, Joey Lastname, are trying to live their best life after tragedy took thier dad from them a few years ago. Things were going pretty well, all things considered. They had jobs, cars, hobbys, and shared an apartment to save up money for their own houses one day. Like everyone else on the planet, however, all that work was for nothing when a mysterious ball of mana powerleveled every living entity on the planet straight to level 25. Combine that with the systems usual bonus multiplyer, meant to give people just a couple bonus levels to help get started, and now everyone on the planet is roughly level 25-200, depending on the multiplyer. In typical fashion, Danny's luck is as good as it is bad, and our hero ended up having the maximum level possible for the multiverse, but cant learn any magic, and has to get bumped down to level 1 because of his Prestige Class, Inventory Mage. Hes left with an immense aura that he cant use, a maximum level inventory with pretty insane capabilities, and a level 1 prestige class that takes 350x the exp to level up. Unlike other mages, all of Dannys magic must come from mana and cores in his inventory. He cannot form his own cores, so he has to figure out how to use collected ones from the wildlife thats constantly trying to eat him for his insane aura. On the first night, little brother Joeys body explodes like roughly 50% of everyone else in the world when he tries using magic for the first time, completely overloading his mana pathways with magic way beyond his bodys acclimation. Luckily his power is to possess vehicles, so his soul was saved, but now hes trapped inside of their old rally car. He can transfer his soul to another vehicle at any time, but it will take great magic to make him a new body. Joeys talent, Upgrade Vehicle, allows him to make any upgrades he can think of as long as he has the materials. Danny and Joey find an abandoned shipyard, and get the idea to use ""Upgrade Vehicle"" on a massive carrier ship still under construction, the USS Enterprise. after collecting every scrap of metal at the shipyard and placing it on the unfinished decks of the carrier, Joey used his talent and upgrades it, making it flight capable and fully completed with tons of added features. This ship will serve as the ""main base"" of the party for the rest of the series. Sister Eleanor, a nun from chicago, was another recipient of a high bonus multiplyer. She is currently the Highest level of all humanity. Before this all happened, she was already a genius, after the comet her intellect became uncalculatable, scaling beyond the standard IQ metric. She took control of the entire worlds internet, infrastructure, military, weapons system, communications, and power grids within minutes of leaving the introductions. She basically forces the world to play nice and focus on survival, and has set up Chicago to be the last bastion of hope for humanity. She did this by designing 12 Mech suits that look like nuns (Nundams?) that she and 11 others use to patrol chicago and its borders, enforcing the peace, and keeping the wildlife back. along with hordes of other inventions and bots designed to help, powered by ambient mana. Trust that the Nundam suits are epic and awesome, powered by portals and turbo engines, to avoid any potential emp or digital attacks. She stays in Chicago to watch over humanity, not joining the party, but is involved heavily. TJ was a former CIA operative turned farmer. His power is rebirth, coming back to life in a new body in a burst of golden energies that he can direct as weapons for a short period of time after regeneration. his power seems to have no limits or fuel source. Hes the wise old man of the party, the veteran. The forge has the power to make/create anything inanimate. Anything he has touched or thought of since gaining his class, he can recreate from mana. This includes magical items like cores and fractals. He combines magical items with technology. This guy makes the weapons and armor for the team to use, his contributions to the team are obvious. Hes also the only person Danny and Joey know from life before the system. Sister Abigaile (Abi) Her power is teleportation or portals, like all the nuns. It is required to run the suits with an external fuel source located in a facility. She was sent to ""Spy"" on mc and his party, to make clear his intentions with the USS Enterprise. She ends up reporting back and deciding to stay with the party, with Sister Eleanors permission. Possible LI for MC if I'm up to the challenge of writing romance. Her use for the team is a powerful frontline fighter. The Nerds power is quantification. His eyes are like black holes, and he can gain almost all info on anything he sees. he is also almost as smart as Sister Eleanor. His main addition to the team is strategy and recon. Chicago is currently under massive construction by armies of automated bots, converting it into a flying City-ship that will eventually be space capable and Earths first Mothership. This will be the main setting for later books in the series. for now its the setting of a large part of book one, act 2. All of the wildlife on the planet was powerleveld with mana, not just Humans. Everything is now huge and hungry and deadly. Most lifeforms also have developed a fractal, usually pertaining to what its known for. Turtles project a sheild, Opossums ""play dead"" and have a second life, ants have a ""Link fractal"" and the queen has a ""Sync fractal"" allowing for perfect control of the swarm. you get the idea.

(Sorry already for the long text) Until now I've always used a famous manufacturer from China (this thing won't even let me mention them... I don't know where to talk about this issue because they would ignore it or attack me in their own server), and except for a mistake happened once (and I never received a refund for it) I've always been okay with them because the quality of their materials and prints is good enough, most of their MOQs are decent, they're patient and even though they're a bit pricier than some others they're mostly affordable for me. I'm not here to recommend them, because THEY JUST STARTED USING AI PICS IN THEIR LISTINGS. The other two manufacturers I know that don't use AI have other problems (one, which I already tried once, has very poor quality material, the other one is Spanish so better from one part but it's a bit pricey and has very few choice of merch types, especially I usually make particular holo pins that they can't make yet :( ), while I avoid all the others I know despite their quality because they use AI generated pictures for every merch of theirs. Maybe if a manufacturer uses AI pics for their listings doesn't necessarily mean they steal their customers' drawings to train it, but I'm still shocked because everyone knows most artists are against that, so I feel like they're making fun of us... Also, I can get it from unknown manufacturers, but this one (and actually some others too) did a lot of collabs with artists, often makes small contests where artists can make fanarts of their mascot and such, and many artists are even willing to draw for them for free- so this is so weird. I hope them and other manufacturers understand their mistakes and change their minds. I'm asking for Europe because thanks to some new laws manufacturers from the USA can't probably ship outside their country without paying a lot 🥲. also, my merch sells but doesn't do big numbers either, so I can't afford big MOQs or prices. (END OF LONG PART, THIS IS THE FINAL QUESTION) So, hoping this r allows it, does anyone know a non-AI manufacturer with affordable MOQs and prices AND a decent quality of materials, which can ship to Europe?",0.065,0.85,0.085,0.9144,pos

Two years ago a question was posted on this sub, *Why did CCD sensors become extinct? Rolling shutter sucks...* u/Rambalac asserted that ""CCD has rolling shutter as well"" and that old consumer cameras did not feature global shutter. He claimed that if a camera does not have global shutter in its specs, it does not have global shutter, ""otherwise there would be no reason to have mechanical shutter."" I googled around and I could not find a single example of a CCD sensor with rolling shutter. In particular: A 2012 whitepaper from ThermoFisher states that CCD only use global shutter: >**Global shuttering, the only imaging mode available for CCD cameras**, exposes each row of pixels to simultaneously expose for the same amount of time and at the same time. The use of global shutter is ideal for both dynamic and fixed sample imaging. Global shuttering is also available for some sCMOS cameras, but at the cost of higher noise and a slower speed. A 2013 whitepaper from ThorLabs states the following in relation to a particular sensor family: >DCU cameras have state-of-the-art CCD sensors while the DCC models are CMOS based. The CMOS models use either the global or the rolling shutter method; **the CCD models use only the global shutter method**. ChatGPT produced the following summary, hinting that interline-transfer CCD may produce rolling-like artifacts: |Sensor Type|Typical Shutter Type|Notes| |:-|:-|:-| |**Full-frame CCD**|**Global shutter**|Entire frame is exposed at once; mechanical shutter often used.| |**Frame-transfer CCD**|**Global shutter**|Charge transferred rapidly to a masked area for readout; exposure is simultaneous.| |**Interline-transfer CCD**|**Global shutter (usually)**|Uses vertical storage registers beside each column; often electronic shutter. Some older or low-cost designs can show *rolling-like artifacts* if readout overlaps exposure.| |**CMOS sensors**|**Rolling shutter (commonly)**|Each row exposed sequentially; can cause distortion with fast motion.| When asked, how rolling-like artifacts can happen, it explained that even though the exposure phase is global, the readout phase is sequential, and this is where artifacts can sneak in. But it is not true rolling shutter, because, * In a true rolling shutter (like most CMOS sensors) each row starts and stops its exposure at a slightly different time. This causes geometric distortions — e.g., skewed vertical lines, wobbly motion. * In an Interline-CCD all rows start and stop exposure together, so object geometry is preserved. Any “rolling-like” artifact is caused by imperfect shuttering, light leakage, or timing overlap — not intentional row-by-row exposure.

Ad revenue: $85/month (Mediavine threshold still feels like a pipe dream). What actually worked: SEO (60% of traffic) - took forever to click but this is what's actually sustainable. Started outsourcing content + mainly link building for $300-400/month around month 5 'cause I was spending way too much time on outreach and getting ghosted.

But the effort-to-traffic ratio is kinda rough? Creating pins takes time and algorithm changes are brutal. Still doing it but not my main focus anymore. Direct/organic social (15%) - random IG stories, TikTok reposts. Nothing crazy. What flopped: Facebook groups - waste of time. Guest posting myself - got maybe 2 acceptances out of 40+ pitches. Trying to go viral on TikTok - lmao no. SEO is slow af but it compounds. Articles from 6 months ago are my top earners now.

As people using AI to contribute to their blog continues to grow I thought I would do a refresher for that topic here. Blogging with AI can involve generating topics and headlines, content, images and infographics, to video and audio like podcasts. Google provide AI overviews that summarise information on its SERP's directly, without a click to content creators from which the information came, limiting organic traffic to blogs more. As a positive to this, that same tool can also be used as an efficient research tool. At its core, AI content and media is at a stage where it's being trained heavily. Once training has become more complete, AI media, or images specifically, used for blogs will have much more originality compared to AI content. This is because while both AI images and AI content are interpreted from text input, the output for images are pixels, whereas the output for text is confined to more text, or dictionary words. To further this representation, as our interpretation of dictionary words as humans into grammar, structured sentences, etc, that we learn growing up and throughout our life are misrepresented when people use AI produced content for their blog posts, is the reason I don't copy AI content to my blog. Having said that, AI media is dangerous. It can generate lifelike videos or images that are completely fake and deceive and mislead the original media and how accurately that media will appear to be real will only evolve. Making the most of AI by generating media such as infographics for your blog and using AI as a research tool to contribute to your blog can take it to the next level and give it more comprehensive coverage of a topic than what a single SERP can provide, improving your niche blog's authority.",0.028,0.9,0.072,0.8913,pos

The VP tells me the timing is “interesting” because another team member happened to leave that same day, and he and the CTO were just talking about raises, with “my name at the top of the list.” What a coincidence. He asked if I’d consider staying if they could “match or come close,” and I said that was my initial thought… but after reflection, that’s not my intention. Today, I met with the CTO. Turns out, they can’t come close to the new offer anyway as their pay bands don’t allow it unless I’m a manager (which, ironically, I should’ve been months ago). He gives me glowing feedback — impact, professionalism, leadership, personality — all the right words. And then I shared some of my own: “I’d encourage the organization to reflect on how it approaches leadership and advancement decisions. The recent hire for the 'Department' Manager role brought extensive 'industry' experience, but lacked the technical foundation in CRM strategy, marketing automation, service software, and website administration that the position truly requires. As a result, much of the execution and strategic direction has continued to rely heavily on the contributors’ involvement.” Boy, did that feel good. Question for y’all: What’s the most fulfilling thing you’ve shared with an organization on your way out?",0.009,0.905,0.087,0.9737,pos

I’m 27, so I don’t really know what the older generation’s sentiment toward big corporations was like around the 2000s. But I guess people used to like companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Apple because they produced enormous innovations that made people’s lives better. Now these companies seem almost purely evil. They are no longer focused on people but endlessly hoarding money and chasing profit. In many ways, they are making people’s lives worse. Meta’s platforms like Instagram and Facebook make people feel lonely and manipulated by content and emotions. Apple keeps releasing phones with almost no real improvements over the previous versions. You can browse the internet and take photos with any phone, yet new iPhones offer no significant upgrades. The clearest sign that corporations are not our friends is how they have used all the content from the internet to train AI for free while at the same time laying off thousands of people. I got invitations for job interviews from these big corporations. They said they have around five rounds of interviews, and I just said thank you and declined. Maybe they pay better, but I prefer to work at a smaller company that won’t treat me like a resource to be tracked and evaluated on multiple rounds on job interview and then at work, only to be laid off heartlessly because they planned to cut a few million dollars from the budget to increase profits for shareholders. Do you think that in a few years we will see people turning against corporations, damaging them, destroying them, even burning them down? The way they lay off around 20k employees and Wall Street cheers it up is sick. This is evil. Do you believe that at some point they will eat their own tail?

These are my Thoughts. I'm Curious What You All Think. The economy is booming. Look at the stock markets. Tariffs are a curveball and there is trepidation in some industries, but other issues are afoot. 1. Private equity. The fact that more mid to large organizations are PE owned than you would know feeds into many of my subsequent points here. PE firms do not care about you. They don't care about the companies they own, the workforce (satisfaction, loyalty, happiness, etc), the brand, the product, the quality or the customer service. In day-to-day life, have you noticed a precipitous drop in quality and competency with your interactions? All they care about are quarterly earnings for the pump and dump. They want to buy a company, create the illusion of improving the company with smoke and mirrors instead of actual improvements so they can turn around and sell it. And they'll probably sell it to another PE firm. Have you also noticed how top-heavy organizations have become? Hordes of MBAs in senior leadership that only skill is to polish turds; strategies to save money and repackage the same thing over and over to build revenue so the company has the appearance of growth and innovation. With their giant salaries, there is no room to build truly talented teams for long-term growth. 2. Harvesting data. I feel 99% of posted positions (I'm looking for manager/director positions in digital strategy/marketing/SEO/website management) are not real. A job will be posted and on LinkedIn alone and it will have over 100 applicants in a few hours. Think of all the other platforms it's posted on. The job will be posted for months then reposted. No HR department wants 10,000 resumes to sift through. At these rates they could find 5 qualified applicants in 3 days and begin interviewing. They are collecting tremendous amounts of personal data they can then sell. My spam calls and emails increase with every application. This data can be leveraged as an ancillary revenue stream and the idea comes from the ""geniuses"" they are hiring in senior leadership. The next reason they would do this is for their personal databases. There is a fear of a ""cookieless"" future so they need all the first-party data they can get in order to continue many digital marketing tactics. 3. AI. I feel many organizations are freezing hiring because they think at any moment there will be an AI solution to do your job. ""If we can keep this skeleton crew working insanely hard they will eventually figure out how to leverage AI to fill the gaps."" Not a completely stupid stance, but yet another MBA strategy for cost savings to hit quarterly revenue numbers and flip the company. This is all coming together in a perfect storm that makes the job hunt increasingly difficult.",0.077,0.81,0.113,0.9723,pos

They were my best student in the class and ironically I just spent the previous class walking them through the content and how to answer... they didn't even need to use AI, they had already told me they knew the answers in-person last week! They simply copied and pasted the assignment in and AI did it. The showed me their chatGPT history of them doing it, even of them making the phrasing simplier to avoid any red flags. This taught ME that any student is willing to use AI, and I simply cannot detect it. I am humbled and disheartened. I look at the other students' assignments and they look similar in style; it could be AI, but I have no way of knowing. There is no reliable way to check outside of blatantly obvious give-aways. I do not know what to do, this is a class that is at a fairly high level (taught in English mostly) and requires conversation, opinions, and essays. Previously, they turned in their work online each week. Now? I do not know what to do, other than making every assignment a closed-computer written test that takes up most of class time. What have YOU all done that has been effective? What are my options?",0.068,0.89,0.042,-0.8272,neg

Why do my students love to ""f\*ck around and find out""? I tell my students at the beginning of the semester that I do not police AI software such as ChatGPT and CoPilot. However, I have the following language in my syllabus (rephrased to protect privacy): AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are not policed. But note, they are prone to generating incorrect, biased, or fabricated information. You are fully responsible for all content you submit — including errors, misinformation, offensive or unethical material — whether it originates from you or an AI tool. If you use AI, you must clearly acknowledge it in your submission. Failure to disclose AI use is considered cheating and a violation of the University’s Academic Integrity Code. **Any violation will result in an automatic grade of 0.** Students are required to complete a syllabus quiz where they are basically asked to restate the course's AI policy. I also have a lecture where I specifically outline tips to help students be successful in the course. The AI policy is also reiterated in that lecture. I gave the students a fairly easy, 50 point assignment. They simply had to write a 2-3 page paper about one of three health topics provided. Students were required to provide 4 objective and/or peer-reviewed sources. I even gave them a great example paper with appropriate sourcing and citation written by a student last semester. I teach two sections of this course, which totals 80 students. After grading, I had to give 0's to 18 students--which is a little over 22% of students. As you probably know, my email is now being bombarded with students asking to redo the assignment as they accuse citation generators, typos, and disappearing journals for their 'unintentional' errors.

There are great textbooks out there, but if I send her one of those, it wouldn't prepare her for the final written exam which is based on the lecture.

I want to get a biomedical or cell biology PhD one day, I would love to study stem cells or cancer biology or something along those lines, I am extremely passionate about it all and cannot see myself doing anything else with my life at all. My low grades are in part due to chronic illness and pain (which caused bad sleep issues and lots of appointments that totally messed with my time management and success in class), as well as the fact that I got all of my prereqs out of the way in high school and began college with really difficult 300 level STEM classes at a school known for being difficult and having grade deflation. I had a better GPA last year compared to my first year, and am trying really hard this year to improve more, and get above a 3.0 threshold for grad admissions. It is so hard because I have tried my best but have struggled to juggle everything and I am not the best test taker, but I feel like I have learned the same amount as my peers and feel very educated, it just isn't reflected. I also have no options for letters of req at the moment. I didn't know I would be graduating early until 6 months ago and thought I would have more time to improve grades and get relationships with professors... My current plan is to try and get a lab based job post graduation and continue my unpaid internship as well to get better research experience... but then what? There is a post bacc research program I am interested in-- but I dont know if I can find letters of req in time for that this year. Next year I could apply to that and some masters programs? Are there good masters programs that I would have a shot in hell at? Or do I just try and work for a few years and then apply to PhDs? Will this improve my odds of admission? Right now all I know is my end goal and I have no clue how to get there. If I work for a while will my grades matter less? Or is there any way they will take my community college grades into account too (which would boost me a ton)? Is my only shot a masters? Am I completely doomed?

Here’s my situation in short: * My application is quite ""basic"". * I have two Letters of Recommendation that are okay, but not exceptional (more along the lines of “It was a pleasure working with him; he’s capable,” etc.). * I don’t have any publications. * My MSc thesis had a small research component, but it was mostly practical. * My grades are decent but not top-tier (around 3.7/4.0 GPA equivalent, or 100/110 in Italy, which isn’t considered outstanding here). * I’m not even applying to places way out of reach (no UK or ETH Zurich-level programs). The biggest issue is that I lack research experience. Apart from my thesis, I haven’t done much research, and my current job has nothing to do with my academic interests. I’m mainly targeting PhDs in Machine Learning / AI or Applied Mathematics (PDEs, SPDEs, or related areas). I usually look for programs on sites like AcademicTransfer, FindAPhD, and AcademicJobs, but so far, no luck. I’ve noticed that pure/applied math PhDs are rare on those portals, is it better to directly contact professors for those? At this point, I’m not sure how to move forward besides sending out more applications while I work full-time. How can I realistically improve my profile? * Should I try collaborating with someone and publishing a paper (and if so, how can I even find people open to that)? * Would doing a pre-doc or research assistant position help, and where can I find these roles? I rarely see them on LinkedIn. My main issue is that the things I have done until now are clearly not working (which are usually emailing the PI of a program I find on those websites with my CV, then applying to that position on the university portal) and I don't really know what else I could do. How can I show ""research experience""? Where can I find people open to ""external contributors"" to their research? If I were to continue working, most jobs in those fields (ML, AI, Math) are either on the engineering side, or require a PhD to do research, so I had no luck entering those either. I’d really appreciate any advice from people who’ve been in a similar position or who know how to strengthen a PhD application. Thanks in advance!",0.037,0.847,0.117,0.9932,pos

My business partner and I started a web design agency building websites for restaurants with custom table reservation systems and CMS. We hustled hard in the beginning - cold outreach, going to restaurants in person trying to persuade owners, building out our portfolio site. Nothing. Absolutely nothing came back. After about 4 months of grinding with zero results, we basically gave up. Didn't shut down the website or anything, just... stopped. We moved on with our lives and didn't touch the business for another 5 months. The website just sat there collecting digital dust. Then yesterday, we get a Discord notification. Someone filled out our contact form asking for a Google Meet. We hop on the call and they're genuinely interested. INTERESTED. In US. Here's the kicker: **We only had 27 organic searches total.** And I'm pretty confident at least 6 of those were me and my partner checking the site on different devices like paranoid maniacs. So somehow, out of maybe 21 actual human visitors, one of them became a client. **The plot twist that saved us:** Months ago, I set up an autonomous workflow that automatically sends contact form submissions straight to our Discord server. If I hadn't done that? We would have NEVER checked that email. We would have ghosted our first (and currently only) potential client without even knowing it. Moral of the story? I have no idea.

I wasn’t looking for theory. I wanted to know which ones still get crawled, indexed, clicked, and approved in 2025. My quick sniff test was simple: the site had to be live, indexable, and visible in search for its own brand queries. Profile pages needed to show up in the HTML (not hidden behind JavaScript or 302 link masks), and approval couldn’t be a black hole. From there I scored each candidate on five things: how reliably profile URLs get indexed, how well the site matches a niche (SaaS/AI/dev/local), whether it has a real SERP footprint (do its category pages rank for anything?), any traffic signal at all, and how painful submissions are. A 70+ score was a “use it,” 50 - 69 meant “maybe, but check manually,” and anything below got cut. What actually holds up? Niche SaaS/AI aggregators that create a dedicated profile page and also tuck you into curated “best tools” roundups are surprisingly strong. Developer/product catalogs are solid too less volume, higher intent. Some startup directories keep an engaged audience via newsletters or X posts; those send little bursts of referral traffic and seem to speed up crawl on new domains. Local citations still matter if you have any local angle at all. And don’t sleep on community-maintained Notion/Airtable lists some of them rank for “best X tools” and quietly deliver clicks. What flops? Parked or resurrected domains built for ad arbitrage, “submission” flows that publish to templates marked noindex, JS-only links that never hit the source, and generic “1,000 links” farms with zero topical curation. If a directory doesn’t rank for its own name, it’s not going to help you. Out of the 5K, I ended up with roughly 420 “keepers” and \~700 “conditional” sites worth mixing in depending on niche and region; the rest weren’t worth touching. On a fresh domain, a paced run of keepers plus some conditionals typically gave me around 40 live listings within two weeks, 5 - 8 new links showing in Search Console, a 10 - 25% lift in referrals from long-tail lists, and those early brand queries that make everything else easier. None of this is a hockey stick it’s quiet infrastructure. But it compounds. Two things mattered more than I expected: pacing and variance. Don’t blast 500 submissions in a day; stagger over two to four weeks. Rotate a few versions of your description, lean on brand and partial-match anchors instead of exact-match spam, and keep 20 - 30% of the work manual add screenshots, tune categories, and ask for inclusion in the right collections. That “human randomness” seems to help with both approvals and indexing. Also, submit the right URL. If a list ranks for “best AI directory tools,” send people to the page that answers that intent your “How it works,” an FAQ, a comparison, or a lightweight free tool rather than dumping everyone on the homepage. Measurement-wise, treat approvals, published pages, and indexed pages as different milestones and track all three. I use GSC for Links/Pages and a lightweight analytics tool for referrals; last-click will miss some assists, so look at blended outcomes over a month, not a day. Once a month, prune dead profiles, refresh screenshots, and ask editors to drop your listing into curated roundups (that’s what actually gets clicked). And yes, nofollow profiles can still help discovery paths and brand queries are value, even when the attribute isn’t dofollow. If you want the exact scoring rubric (columns/weights) and a small sanitized sample of the “keepers,” say the word and I’ll share it based on the sub’s rules.

We’re a 4-person remote crew running ads and storefronts in multiple regions (tariffs made our old setup way too expensive), so managing all the accounts securely became a nightmare, with various logins, constant IP flags, and ad accounts getting randomly banned. We improved our workflow around Multi-account management: a few months ago, we switched to AdsPower to manage everything in one place. Basically, it lets us create isolated browser profiles for each platform or market, each with its own fingerprint and proxy. Everyone on the team has their own access level, and I can track who’s logged in where. It's useful when you’ve got contractors in different time zones. We automated repetitive processes: when a new region/store opens, we spin up a profile, assign a team member, deploy a base ad campaign template, hook it into a tracker. For existing accounts we set up macros or scripts to check key metrics, pull snapshots and alert us if spend is under/over threshold. That saved us time (so the team can focus on strategy, creative and channels) and scaled without adding full-time hires. **My final take:** If you’re a small team trying to expand internationally or diversify channels (because tariffs or costs forced you to), you don’t need another overpriced platform or a 20-person ops team. What helps is: \- A tool that supports office automation (macro tasks, templates) \- One that enables secure multi-account management (we use AdsPower) \- One that supports remote team roles with access control and clear audit logs \- A system scaled so you can test new regions/channels without blowing your budget",0.034,0.84,0.126,0.9761,pos

The fewer times I touch each order, the faster I can clear the day! 😅 **👉 Route and delivery planning (game changer)** Once orders are packed, I import the addresses into Locate2u to optimize the route and schedule the driver runs.

Still ended up raising from VCs and eventually moving to SF. The way I did it was basically brute-forcing a system for “warm intros” without actually knowing anyone. Quick context: At pre-seed I spoke with \~70 investors. At seed I spoke with \~175. 166 passed. **Expect to get at least 99 “no”s before the first “yes”.** At the beginning I did everything wrong... pitches too long, reached the wrong investors, no urgency, let investors decide timing, etc. Once I started treating fundraising like a numbers game instead of a “vibe game”, everything changed. The single hack that moved the needle the most for me: >**Instead of DM’ing investors, I DM’d portfolio founders first.** For every target VC, I went to their website → opened the portfolio → found founders in my sector → connected with them on LinkedIn. For each VC I would reach \~15 portfolio founders. 3 would accept a quick 15-min chat. And 1–2 ALWAYS ended up giving me a warm intro to their investor. Why this works: When the investor gets your deal from their own founder, they treat you like you’re already “in the round”. It instantly creates urgency and flips the power dynamics. It makes them think “others are already in if I wait, I might lose the deal”. Also: fundraising is 50% how strong your company is, and 50% how well you *run* the process. Urgency beats raw traction. If you compress investor conversations into a dense window, you'll be able to build FOMO, which is the driver behind all the rounds you see out there where you feel like ""how the f...k those guys raised that much with no traction...!!"". If you rise going for 1 call per week, nothing will happen. Fundraising felt like a full-time job on top of running the startup. But this process gave me a repeatable way to constantly generate warm intros and keep momentum alive. Later, because so many founders kept asking me about this, I built EasyVC, using AI to do the heavy lifting (finding the right investors + automating outreach to portfolio founders on LinkedIn). But the manual version above already works if you grind it. Happy to answer questions!",0.03,0.866,0.104,0.9718,pos

I started doing some debugging to find out why it is so slow and talking to AI. Turns out that every page load is doing about 4 requests back and forth across the Atlantic, between server and database. I have to do user auth check > load businesses > load reviews > load analysis. I now spent 4 hours yesterday redeploying all of the servers to Frankfurt, so that they're in the same area, and now the app loads in like half a second. I can't believe how easy this was to solve and I didn't solve it, I just assumed that it might be a complicated issue or that my server hardware was too cheap. I feel bad for my users that have been using the app to date and have had to wait like 10 seconds every time. Anyway, we learn and improve for the next product. The product is Sashy, for anyone interested. You click on the Demo on the homepage and see how quick it loads now. Anyone else had any other fails like this?",0.032,0.864,0.103,0.9853,pos

LegalAdviceUK,post,1oe16rq,,1761220317.0,3,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1oe16rq/flytipping_nightmare_england/,"Fly-Tipping Nightmare - England I’m a leaseholder owner of a flat in a block of ten flats in London. All residents of the building are either leaseholders or tenants of leaseholder landlords. On the other side of the car park to our building is an identical block of flats, and in the middle there are two terraced rows of social housing. Between us, we comprise a single estate run by a privately owned housing association, to whom residents pay a monthly service charge for maintenance, repairs, and so on. The housing association are the freeholders of the buildings on the estate. In recent years an epidemic of fly-tipping has blighted the estate, and leaseholders have been asked to pay additional costs beyond the normal service charge to mitigate the problem. There is no evidence that any of the extra measures for which we have paid have actually been carried out. The situation reached boiling point about a month ago when each flat received a demand from the housing association to pay a supplementary one-off charge of £440.44 in addition to the usual £215 (approx.) monthly service charge (which itself has increased by over 200% in the last three years). Residents are refusing to pay. I would like to know our rights to force the housing association to actually install the measures for which we have paid. Key facts: * The fly-tipping problem stems from the communal bins stored in a separate shed-sized brick outbuilding in the car park. Residents collect household waste in bin bags in their homes as normal, and once those bin bags are full, they dispose of them in the communal bins. The outbuilding is secured from public access with a heavy door that can only be opened by keys given to all residents. HOWEVER, the keys used to unlock the doors are fire brigade keys, freely available at any high street key cutter or online for less than £1 a key. * The estate is located relatively near to a dual carriageway leading to the M25. Builders and traders have cottoned on to the fire brigade key loophole, and regularly dump commercial waste in our communal bins on their way in and out of London. Because it is commercial waste, our regular weekly bin collectors refuse to take it, and therefore the housing association intermittently pay for additional Bulk Refuse collection to clear the outbuilding, for which we are charged extra. * In the last few months the problem has gotten so bad that on multiple occassions it has been impossible to physically close the doors on the outbuilding because there is so much commercial waste inside. Last week the doors were wide open for four days straight due to discarded concrete paving slabs poking out. There has also been a dead fridge-freezer lying face down on the grass next to the outbuilding for the best part of six months. The fly-tippers know that our regular bin collection is on Tuesday morning, and so it is not uncommon to see flatbed trucks lining up on a Tuesday afternoon, because they know that that is when the outbuilding will be at its emptiest. * Fly-tipping is a nationwide problem, and residents do not expect for it to be completely eliminated from the estate. Each year, we receive an annual service charge statement from the housing association showing a breakdown of allocated spending vs actual costs. When I first moved to the estate in 2018, the allocated spending for Bulk Refuse collection was roughly £2,000 per year, and the actual cost usually turned out to be slightly less (between £1,500 and £2,000). Any underspend was rolled in to the estate sink fund. This changed around 2022/23, when the actual cost leapt to over £4,000. The housing association responded by increasing the allocated spending for the following year to £4,000. The actual cost in that year rose to around £8,000. Guess what happened next? Yep, you guessed correctly. The housing association increased allocated spending for 2024/25 to £8,000, and the actual cost turned out to be just shy of £12,000. * The most recent service charge statement shows the 2024/25 supplementary charge of £440.44 to be paid by each resident is predominantly (but not exclusively) due to excess Bulk Refuse collection. The 50% year on year increase is not sustainable. At this rate residents will each be paying the best part of £3,500 in supplementary charges within the next five years. * The housing association has an online portal for residents to raise complaints. Additionally, we have a ‘Property Manager’ that we can email directly. Every resident in my building (not sure about the others on the estate) has emailed/lodged complaints about fly-tipping costs over the years, and not one of us has received a reply. The best we get is a generic email sent from the Property Manager maybe two to three times a year saying words to the effect of “We take fly-tipping very seriously. We are looking into solutions to the problem. In the meantime, if you know who is doing the fly-tipping report them to the police.” I personally have emailed the Property Manager twice since receiving the 2024/25 service charge statement, and so far in response have only received an automated reminder saying that I owe them £440.44. My next door neighbour tells me he has received a letter (which I haven’t seen) from the housing association saying that if he does not pay the additional £440.44 then it will be automatically taken from his bank account over the next month via direct debit (our regular monthly service charge payments are paid this way). * To be clear, residents are not opposed to paying the £440.44 one off cost provided that the fly-tipping problem is dealt with. What has become clear in the last few years is that the housing association has absolutely no intention of dealing with the problem, as it is easier/cheaper for them to pass the costs on to us. We have had multiple written assurances from the Property Manager about measures taken, for which we have been charged extra, none of which have actually happened. These include (but are not limited to) the installation of CCTV and the installation of numeric keypad locks on the outbuilding doors. The written assurances do not say that these measures WILL be taken, they say that they HAVE been taken already, yet quite clearly there are no CCTV cameras or numeric keypads to be found anywhere on the estate. * Other non-fly-tipping related services for which residents have paid through the years but have not received include a new carpet for the internal communal areas, and cleaning. The carpet was due to be replaced as part of wider repairs to the building last year (that’s a whole ‘nother saga) but we were later told the carpet would not be replaced due to overspend on the repairs. Cleaning in the communal areas ceased in February of this year – absolutely no idea why – and since then residents have taken to cleaning it themselves. On the noticeboard in the internal communal area there are timesheets that the cleaners are supposed to write on each week to show that they have done the cleaning – these are blank from February onwards. When my neighbour called the Property Manager to complain about this, he was told that he was wrong and that cleaners were regularly attending. The Property Manager later admitted in one of his generic emails that cleaning was not being done and he was “working to resolve” the issue. That was four months ago. So help us out, Reddit! Ultimately, we would like the annual Bulk Refuse spend to be brought back to under £2,000. To do this we need to force the housing association to take action. When we complain to the housing association we are either ignored, or we are told measures are being taken that are not actually being taken. We do not wish to get into legal trouble by refusing to pay the additional £440.44 to cover last year’s Bulk Refuse spend, but at the same time we know that if we do pay it then the problem will just roll over to next year at an even higher cost. Thanks in advance for your help! tldr: Fly-tipping epidemic on our estate. Housing association refusing to tackle the issue and instead are passing the costs directly on to us. How do we force them to take action?",0.08,0.881,0.039,-0.9921,neg

When the accident first happened marshmallow, our insurer, assigned us a solicitor and wanted us to go through them and also get a car hire through them. Did my research and understood that this is a trick they do to squeeze more money from the other party but can also back fire and I end up paying a large amount as the agreement with the solicitors is not regulated. We rejected that and wanted to go through the normal route, marshmallow tried to convince us other wise and they almost had no easy way of actually just claiming directly with them. We did eventually get them to pay for fixing the car. Last I heard from marshmallow was 31 weeks ago where their customer service said other party have accepted fault but they are chasing the funds. I have since then been asked to again work with solicitors to recover the funds, however this time there is a thread from marshmallow that my insurance could be void if I don't cooperate and have to pay the costs. My question is, do I have to cooperate with the solicitors even though I've already cooperated with marshmallow previously? If I have to, do I also have to go to court with me as a Claimant? If yes, what happens if they lose the case, is there any outcome that means I am responsible for the legal fees? Email from marshmallow: Good Afternoon, We write in relation to your claim. We have received correspondence from our panel solicitors, HF, in which they have specified that you have failed to cooperate with their investigations. It is a condition of your policy to cooperate with us at all stages of your claim. Not doing so is a breach of the terms and conditions of your policy. If we do not receive a response from you within 7 days for the requested information, we will advise your policy underwriters who may take action on your policy. This action could include voiding your policy, which will cause all cover to cease. In addition to this, due to your non-cooperation, we may need to settle third party claims that we may have been able to avoid. If this is the case, we will seek full reimbursement from you for any costs incurred. Email from solicitors: Q1-9 are generic about the accident and damage damage 10 Do you consent to H-F Solicitors issuing proceedings in order to make a recovery? Shall we get to a stage of issuing do you give us consent to issue court proceedings citing your name as the Claimant, please bear in mind that you will not incur any costs for the legal costs. The third party’s insurer has disputed liability, we will need your consent in order to issue proceedings. Kindly provide us with any evidence that you may hold in support of the claim witnesses, cctv footage etc. 11. In the case that you do have any uninsured losses you wish us to claim for would you like to provide your BACS details (account number and sort code)? This is so we can transfer any recovered monies to you once recovery has been made. If you are unsure on providing these, this can be skipped and sorted at a later date. I've used AI and go the following answer when I uploaded my policy documents which I can't seem to upload to this post. The requirement for you to be named as the Claimant in court proceedings (a process known as subrogation or assignment of claim) is standard practice in motor insurance. Your policy specifies this requirement primarily under Section 14: General Conditions, Part 1: Accidents, losses and claims. 1. Why You Have to Be the Claimant You have to be the Claimant because the right to sue the party at fault for the accident legally belongs to the person who suffered the loss—which is you, the policyholder. * The Nature of the Loss: Even though your insurer, Marshmallow, paid for the damage (their loss), the legal action against the third party must be brought by you to recover the entire loss caused by the third party, not just the insurer's outlay. * The Recovery of Uninsured Losses: By acting in your name, the solicitors (HF) are able to simultaneously claim back your uninsured losses (such as your policy excess and any personal expenses like hire car fees or loss of earnings) alongside the money Marshmallow paid out. They cannot legally recover your uninsured losses without your consent and participation. Marshmallow is exercising their right to pursue a recovery action, which your policy grants them through the legal concept of subrogation. 2. Where the Policy Specifies This Your Marshmallow Motor Insurance Policy Wording document addresses this requirement directly: The Right to Assignment (Legal Basis) The policy gives the insurer the right to control the recovery process: > ""We shall be entitled to take an assignment of any claim that you may have against another person in connection with any loss that is the subject of any claim under this policy meaning that we may, after settling your claim under this policy, investigate, defend and settle such assigned claim seeking to recover costs from any at fault party."" > This clause means that once the insurer pays out on your claim, they are legally allowed to take over your right to sue the person who caused the loss, and they do so by using your name as the Claimant. The Duty to Cooperate (Your Obligation) Your consent to be named as the Claimant falls under your obligation to cooperate with the insurer and their solicitors: > ""You must give us whatever cooperation, information and assistance we require in dealing with any claim under this policy."" > Your failure to grant consent for them to issue proceedings in your name is viewed as a breach of your duty to provide ""cooperation, information and assistance"". The policy warns that failure to comply could have severe consequences: > ""Failure to do so could result in the claim being refused and/ or your policy being cancelled."" > In summary: You must be the Claimant because the law requires it for a recovery action, and your policy explicitly grants the insurer the right to pursue this action in your name and obligates you to cooperate. Refusing consent would breach your policy conditions.",0.107,0.8,0.093,-0.9777,neg

Any advice is appreciated. I asked chatgpt but I don’t fully understand the ai slob. Thank you for your patience :)",0.02,0.852,0.128,0.8776,pos

Creepy teacher + panic attacks My teacher is a creep (60+M), and I (26F) feel like things have come to a head. I need to decide whether to quit before the end of year performance or stick it through. Here is little breakdown of what has happened over the course of the year: EDIT: I'm a real person and my heart is broken by the responses I've been getting. I'm real flesh and blood and I wrote this with my own fingers in a distressed state- no AI help or anything. I'm not sure how this comes off as fake. I'm articulate and have had a lot of time to think and piece it together coherently, is that so rare these days?? I'm so confused. How else could I have come to ask for help in this situation? Go on my profile to see what else I write, hell you can even hear me sing. The responses here have worsened my faith in the acting industry. If ya'll were a jury I'd be fucked. A lot of the comments have been taken down by moderators but they still have an impact. * Took a special interest in me and kept me back in class to talk. This became a regular thing and at first, I was flattered by his attention. My classmates were jealous and called me the 'queen of movement' because I do have a natural ability. One person dropped out because she was sick of the favouritism. Fair enough, I would have too. He began contacting me over email and text mostly with relevant stuff and contacts * He found out that I pole dance and his face lit up. He found out about a pole dance showcase I was doing and, despite my hints for him not to come, he came. I felt like bc he bought an expensive ticket, I had to go spend time with him in the audience so I did. He pulled me to the back at the bar and kept trying to buy my a drink and asking to leave to go to a bar with me- trying to engage me in conversation while all my friends were performing on stage and I was missing them. I kept saying no and trying to redirect my attention to the stage and he kept saying things like ""after this year you'll never see me again"" and i was confused thinking ""what are u trying to bait me into saying??"" But I was silent and said 'oh ok'. He said ""you're not saying anything. I'm trying really hard here"" and i said ""I'm just processing whats happening right now"" and he tried touching my face and asking what its like kissing my boyfriend (I don't have one and never told him of one) and telling me how sexy/beautiful I am with makeup on and getting far too touchy on my knee and stuff, telling me how I reminded him of his daughter (fkn gross). He told me about how he needs ""women"" to feel inspired creatively and told me about how much he has cheated on his wife- as if he was boasting and inviting me to be his next mistress or something. I remained silent but I looked at him and felt sad ""this guy is such a loser"" I thought and I pitied him * Since then, I have detached and avoided him and after the first class back from that event, he chased me down the road after class and said ""you seem upset with me whats wrong"" and I said ""nothing"" and walked off. I wanted to leave no more room for emotional intimacy or familiarity, I wanted to return to being simply a student. * In every opportunity in class he has had to touch me, he has. Put his finger through mine (in a very sexual way like finger-through-hole), touched my neck, requested a kiss on a cheek... * Recently in a class he walked in with a foul mood- apparently, he had little faith in the end of year performance and was fresh out of inspiration. I wonder if it was because I had given him such little attention or wiggle room. He then turned on me in front of everyone saying ""you have everything it takes to be a great actor but you're burning yourself out and you have some deep emotional issues and you need to let go more""- all which is valid when said tenderly in private but it was aggressively while i stood on stage under a spotlight in front of my whole gossipy class. It felt like he was blaming or me or trying to humiliate me, thinly veiled under care. Funnily enough the class got jealous of how much attention I got and then asked him do a ""cold hard psychoanalysis"" on them too. * After that class I contacted the director of the acting school to pull out of the class and he convinced me to stay without knowing the full story. * In the next class, he tackled me to the floor to demonstrate a 'pretend kiss' and he said ""stop resisting"" and I said ""well i don't want it to happen"" and he went ahead and did it anyway. Whenever he touched me, this gross look of satisfaction would set into his face. Whenever he touched me I felt deeply disturbed and like he was taking something from me, even if energetically. I've lost sleep from feeling so disturbed, I would often lose sleep and feel enraged * I contacted him via text the next day saying ""please don't touch me again and please don't attack my character publically, any critique you have can you please focus on my work. I want to feel like the classroom space feels respectful and professional"" and he took HUGE offence to it, and suggested he ""wouldn't care if you chose to pull out fo the end of year performance"". I got the director involved who said my text was far too direct and not diplematic and that ""if you had of sent me that text and I'd hired you for a set then I'd fire you"". So then, in my defence, I told him the full story, he was appalled by this teacher's conduct and sorry for my experience but convinced me to continue with the performance. But my heart isn't in it. I feel fundamentally unsafe and unhappy in the class. I don't believe in my pieces and I never want to see this guy again. I feel like I've learnt as much as I could from him. His style of performance is cartoonish and showy whereas I'm more subtle and deep so theres that misalignment of approaches and taste too. The pieces that I have been given to perform for the end of year performance... I do not like. I have to wear a big plastic mask for 2 of them (I have sensory issues), there's elements of tasteless perversion, profound misogyny and it's generally got a weird feeling - the show in it's entirety. Last class, the teacher said ""I want this to be a very sexy play... like not overtly sexy but you know when you can see the line of a womans underwear when she wears a short skirt and its somehow more sexy than her just in underwear? I want it to be like that"". The concept of the show is an outline of heteronormative 'life' and elements of falling in love, dying, birth, having sex etc. It's very basic and outdated. I kinda feel sick by the whole thing. He keeps blowing smoke up his own ass talking about all the awards he has received. He showed us Slav's Snowshow on yt as a reference and if we were to do something as awesome as that, I'd be so down but it really doesn't feel like its coming together even close. It's far too pervy. Other pieces include a 'sex scene' and a scene where one of the new students (she's only 19) has to be in underwear while a male undresses her on stage. What are your thoughts? I know the industry is full of weirdos like this and I don't want to be a pansy who just pulls out when she's uncomfortable but I've been having insane panic attacks at 4am, getting no sleep, feeling really stricken with weird feelings.... the thought of leaving it brings me a profound sense of peace. Though I feel sad to leave it, abandon my scene partner.... this was going to be the performance I was going to finally reveal to my parents ""I've been doing acting all year! Look at this!"" and I'll be abandoning that vision too. Also don't want the director to think ill of me and have that affect my career and opportunities. He's very judgemental and a narc too. I need help figuring out what to do, I've got to many emotions and brain fog clouding my ability to see this clearly. Thank you for taking the time to read through all this, I really appreciate it.

music,post,1od3jnh,,1761125171.0,1,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1od3jnh/electronic_history_on_the/,"Electronic History: On the Industrial-Hardcore-Techno connection Hi Friends, Here is a new text I wrote. This time it's about the connection of the early Industrial and later Techno scene. *Note: No AI was used when writing this text.* ""Techno"" has plenty of roots. Two well-known ones are the ""Detroit"" sound of the 80s, and the funky House sound that eventually turned into full-blown Acid House via Ibiza and the Brits. The ""Industrial"" roots are sometimes acknowledged, often overlooked. The truth is that a lot of ""Techno"" pioneers were very active in the earlier Industrial and EBM movements, and the darker parts of the Synth Pop culture. It was a very straight evolution - being an Industrial musician in the 80s, then the ""switch"" to Techno when the 90s began. Yet there is a reason that there is not as much attention on this Industrial influence than on the other ""roots"". These musicians usually stayed attached to the darker, harsher, more brutal forms of Techno, and when Hardcore and Gabber got into full swing, they went there, too. And to even more extreme sounds like Speedcore and Breakcore as the 90s went on. So let us look at some of these. Given the topic, the view is mostly on artists from the earlier days of Techno, in the 90s. **Industrial Strength Records** One of the earliest American Techno and Hardcore labels - based in New York City And the name gives it away - there is a huge Industrial influence. By the mid 90s, and onwards, it gained a huge surge of popularity within the ""Gabber"" scene. But its eggs found their way into many baskets - the sound fueled the US warehouse rave scene, the European squat underground, or its compilation CDs were released on the prime extreme Metal label of the 90s - Earache Records. While Techno / Rave / Dance elements are a-plenty on this label, this is not some cheese / good-time music for sure! We hear the sound of hammering pistols, screaming metal, and howling machines on this one. Listening suggestions: DX 13 - Mother F\*\*ker New York Temper Tantrum - Industrial Strength Nasenbluten - Concrete Compressor **Planet Core Productions** ""Phuture - An Industrial Project"" is written in big black letters on the pages of the booklet, when you open up the eponymous 1994 compilation by this Frankfurt label. Marc Acardipane - ""head honcho"" of the label - once stated his mission was to combine the dark sounds by the likes of Front 242 with the more funky sounds coming from Detroit and Chicago at the same time. And while the label later found fame within the stark raving Dutch Gabber scene, the industrial roots are undeniable. Listening suggestions: Mescalinium United - We Have Arrived Cold Blooded Split - Invaders Reincarnated Regulator - Mindeater **The Horrorist** The Horrorist was so industrial that Depeche Mode actually invited him and a few other hand-picked fans to join him in their bus of the 101 tour and video! But all silliness aside, Oliver Chesler was deeply ingrained in New York's industrial electronic underground. He later picked up the Techno beats, too, and joined above-mentioned Industrial Strength Records, and other labels. He spawned several worldwide hits (""Flesh is the fever"" became a Dutch Gabber hit, ""DJ Skinhead"" became a terror-speedcore hit, and ""One night in NYC"" went #1 on the German dance charts). But there was always a fling with industrial music as the backdrop, now and then. Listening suggestions: The Horrorist - Can You Hear the sound? The Horrorist - Flesh is the Fever The Horrorist & Marc Acardipane - Metal Man **Praxis Records** The Praxis crew was deeply embedded within the Swiss industrial and electronic underworld of the 80s. In fact, Praxis has an industrial avant-garde precursor, Vision Records. But then they went to the UK, got entangled in the dangerous London anarchist / squat / traveler / rave culture. How many successful electronic labels of the 90s can rightfully claim that they were run by itinerants who did not even have a residential address (let alone a shower) ? Before finally settling in Berlin, and becoming part of the new Breakcore ""thing"". Listening suggestions: Bourbonese Qualk - Logic Bomb Base Force One - Phuturist Society of unknowns - Dead by Dawn (The Endless Mix) **Fischkopf** From Berlin we move to another German city, Hamburg. The home of Fischkopf was a record store on the second floor of a clothes outlet selling subcultural fashion within the city's red light district. So a trip to Fischkopf always became a rite of passage, passing by bondage gear stores, blue movie cinemas, pimps with brass knuckles, and cracked heads with jackknives. The label's roster was international and the influences were wide-spread. You had more Gabber or Techno types doing releases, but also a lot of artists who were active or fans in the original industrial scene before they sailed to these new horizons. Listening suggestions: Auto-Psy - Ovoide Taciturne - In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi Eradicator - Worringen **Digital Hardcore Recordings** We are back in Berlin again! DHR was not only a label with industrial influences (input), but also one that made it quite big within the industrial community itself (output). Which 90s industrial-goth teen did not have a crush on Alec or Hanin? (I know I did!) There is also breakcore, metal-gabber, hard acid on this label, but, yup, it's industrial too! Listening suggestions: Ec8or - Discriminate the next Fashionsucker Sonic Subjunkies - Central Industrial Atari Teenage Riot - Redefine the Enemy **Biochip C / Street Trash Alliance** German producer Martin Damm became involved in the projects of music publishing company ZYX and the labels Boy / Generator Records. These helped to spread Industrial music to the masses in Germany and across the borders via some of their compilations and releases. Martin Damm later became a Hardcore, Speedcore, and ""Frenchcore"" legend. But his early releases were ingrained in the Industrial, EBM, and New Beat sound. And maybe he is the one with the most ""immediate"" Industrial influence. A lot of tracks contain plainly visible nods to early bands and projects. O - Das Spiel Cyberchrist - Information Revolution Part 2 Napalm - Napalm !!! There is more out there. But we will talk about that when ""The Stars Turn and a Time Presents Itself"". **Part 3** So, how did Industrial culture cross over into Techno and, later, Hardcore? On a technological level (pun intended), it's the production methods, synths, ideas... Industrial artists sampled movies, speeches, other records... and put these vocal snippets into their songs / tracks. Often these were otherwise ""instrumental"" tracks where, on a conceptual level, the sampled narration of a horror movie or a political speech ""replaced"" the singer that would be there if it was a conventional pop / rock song. This was done in early Techno, too. With the addition that these short voices or truncated parts of a speech got looped - or got re-triggered at machine-gun speed. When Techno producers dropped this habit as the 90s went on, the industrial sampling heritage found its new home in the Hardcore and Gabber scene. Where the choices of sources were oddly similar to that of the Industrial community: horror flicks, alien movies, interviews from the mental asylum... The hippies had their electronic Krautrock / Ambient, playing 11+ minute long synthesizer ""solos"" that went everywhere and nowhere, being stoned out of their mind while eager european businessmen and journalists watched by in the 70s. But it took the advent of Industrial to finally get some sequencer-based, ""tight"" electronic form of music - that was not done by a funky Moroder in a Beverly Hills sound studio (no diss against Giorgio at all - but you know what I mean!). Like some German New Wave legend remarked on TV once: ""I would never have considered 'Hot on the Heels of Love' to be part of disco music. Even though everyone danced to it."" \[paraphrased\] And the choice of sounds. Peter Gabriel might have spent 4 weeks finding a way to record a metal pipe hitting a metal object (or was that Phil?). Yet the artists of Industrial music took this way farther. Machinery, drills, jackhammers (hello, Neubauten!), pile drivers were now a welcome addition to an artist's music. Recorded, used for improvisation, during live shows, or for drilling a hole through a wall, into the green room, during a live show (hello again, Neubauten!). Noise was now a type of music too, you know. I must admit that early Techno and House had not much of that. But later Hardcore and Gabber had a similar sweet tooth for sheer loudness and abrasive hissing+screeching mayhem. Just three examples - and this just covers the technical side of things so far. And with these words, dear reader, we leave you for the night.",0.048,0.892,0.061,0.947,pos

I'd keep skills at the bottom, but arrange them in a paragraph format as opposed to a triple column format because the latter could potentially cause issues with all their applicant tracking systems. 3. The other thing I would consider is that the key achievements are kind of out of context. For example, if I'm reading the first bullet under that key achievement section, I don't know where that took place. I'm assuming it's under the current role, but I could be wrong. So it's good to add some context there. 4. It's also a good idea to keep them a little shorter. They shouldn't exceed a single line because they're supposed to be very skimmable. 5. Lastly, I would add context to roles by describing the type of organization you work for, how large it is, which industry it is in, what kind of products and services it provides, what kind of customers it caters to, and how you support it at a high level. You want to lead with this in each role before you dive into the nitty-gritty.",0.016,0.925,0.059,0.8685,pos

So I’m not sure what your kid’s school has, but I’m guessing they didn’t shell out for the monitoring program if your kid isn’t getting programs closed for her or blocked. So your options are, as far as I can see them: -block AI through your ISP. This is possible, but probably kinda tricky. She’d still be able to access it with cell service, but it sounds like she’s at the point where I wouldn’t recommend a smartphone. -go to in-person school and deal with the disruptions if at all possible. The school can probably work with you to create a plan for this. It sounds like she’s using AI to try to create a social life, so even getting her more social connections through clubs or just taking a class or two in-person, even if she’s still mostly homeschooling, could be ideal. Is there a time of day that’s usually better, where she could pop in for one period or something? -Stop the online school and switch to traditional homeschooling, possibly with a homeschooling group?

More than that, you gotta do some research for better treatment. But start small and really see if the work is for you.",0.027,0.915,0.058,0.3716,pos
