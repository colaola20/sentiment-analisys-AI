Hi everyone, I'm quite new to Reddit so apologies in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. I post my stories online and have a mail publicly available in case a fan wants to share fanart. Recently, in my mails I've been flooded with what I assume to be scam e-mails. I'd like to take the opportunity to a) warn fellow writers against scammers (since this is one strategy I haven't seen mentioned on Reddit before) and b) ask fellow writers how they quickly spot scams. As I'm not sure if it's legally okay to post a screenshot of the e-mail I received, I'll copy and paste the phrasing below and censor the name. \--- Hi, I’m **\[weirdly spelled name\]**, organizer of the **Boozy Book Club**, a vibrant community of readers who gather each month to explore books that challenge, inspire, and linger long after the last page. We’re preparing for our **November 8th Author Celebration**, a special event recognizing exceptional works that have sparked genuine conversation and moved our members in unexpected ways. Your book, **""Killing Butterflies""**, immediately stood out for its voice, depth, and the way it engages with readers on such a human level. This celebration isn’t about formalities or competition, it's about connection. It’s about shining a light on stories that deserve to be talked about, shared, and celebrated among readers who truly value meaningful storytelling. We’d be honored to spotlight **""Killing Butterflies""** during this upcoming event, sharing it across our community and featuring it in our group discussion. Would you be open to having **""Killing Butterflies""** featured at our **November 8th event**? \--- The book club in question does exist, but is inactive from what I've seen on facebook. I couldn't find the person who claims to be the organizer there either, which makes this very likely a scam (at least to me). Also, the way the e-mail is phrased kinda just screams AI to me. Has anyone been contacted with such a dubious offer? Should I just ignore it? Thanks for your help in advance!",0.076,0.813,0.111,0.7301,pos

My skills are only limited to imaginative monsters/creatures/aliens. I cannot draw humans or backgrounds or anything really other than things that don’t exist. But with my imagination I have so many ideas for stories I want to tell through pictures. Think Marcus Yu for example. His story telling through pictures and sounds is incredible I just don’t have the skills that he has for humans and backgrounds. For example I would take a picture of a forest, turn it black and white, add grainy texture, mess with the lighting a bit, and then add my creature drawings on top of that, so my art on top of a filtered picture. Another example is Trevor Henderson, he draws on top of real life pictures which is what I want to do with my stories. My post is would people hate my stories if I use real life pictures and give them a black and white/grainy filter and use those to tell my stories? I will still be adding my own touch to these images to make them not complete copy and pasted, and I’ll still include a load of my own drawings. It’s just like landscapes and structures I can’t do it very well. I’d rather use images with a filter than use Artificial Intelligence images to create the backgrounds. I just don’t want these stories and ideas to remain in my head, I want to give them life and maybe post them as a YT video one day but I don’t want them to be frowned upon and the stories to be given up by people before they even read/watch them because the backgrounds and other features of the stories aren’t “real art” just pictures with a filter. And of course if the picture is by a photographer I’d give credit. An example for an idea that I’m working on involves a nasa control room. I cannot draw a control room and all of the little details to save my life so I took a picture form google, made it black and white, added grainy texture, and included details that fit my story into it. And then I made some slides from scratch, and sometimes there’s no pictures online and I suffer and make some pretty bad sketches of people and backgrounds but it gets the point across. Any thoughts on this? Thanks in advance!",0.055,0.836,0.109,0.9599,pos

To wit, if someone was clever enough to craft a plausible Utopian society in science fiction, one that could actually work given human nature, existing power structures, and our propensity for using violence to solve problems...then that author should be put in charge of the country to enact that system instead of writing novels. My theory is that Dystopian is easier to write because you just have to start with ""What could go wrong and how would life be different after that"" instead of ""let's craft a perfectly plausible solution to all our problems that would result in humans lasting another 100, 1000, or 10000 years"". And I'm not lumping Eschatology in with Dystopian. Dystopian can happen AFTER the so-called ""end of the world"" but they're not the same. I've heard it said that Dystopian is what happens when you take the modern life and problems of poor, marginalized, and oppressed people...and apply that to people with wealth and power. And honestly, I can't really poke holes in that. Global pandemic novel? There are already global pandemics that only affect the poor and marginalized. Looking at you Tuberculosis and Ebola. Robots taking over? I came up through the auto industry and I personally helped the robots take over manufacturing (and offshore outsourcing, sorry about that). Dictatorships, autocracies, religious theocracies, 24/7 digital surveillance, all these things exist for some population out there now. But if we apply those to well off white folks from New Hampshire, or tech bros from the Bay area, then it's suddenly Dystopian, right? Even the one franchise that is often held up as Utopia adjecent, Star Trek, kinda just glosses over how they all got to a spacefaring quasi-socialist meritocracy. What are your thoughts on the paradox of Utopian storytellers, namely if they are actually GOOD at writing a solution, then they should be implementing that solution IRL and not writing novels.",0.074,0.825,0.101,0.8761,pos

My husband is an amateur filmmaker and I often work with him as a writer. We're brainstorming a new film project at the moment - he came to me with a basic premise and he'd like to go in a direction rooted in a blend of Ruben Östlund and Lynch. The basic premise being a young socially awkward woman who comes into possession of a robot ""boyfriend"" who seems to fulfill all her needs at first but has a corrupting influence as she enjoys the power it gives her. Of course we don't want to rehash concepts that were already done well in films like Her or Stepford Wives (even if gender is being inverted). I thought focusing on the psychology and even existential issue of what it means to be human or intimate, and focusing on the human soul would be an interesting direction, at which point he said ""Lost Highway"". So we've been tossing around some ideas about how a Lynchian approach could elevate the concept - undermining self-identity and reality, dream logic, exploring fundamental human evil, the breakdown of one's sanity, circular / non-linear chronology, etc. What techniques / story elements would you consider ""Lynchian""? Have you ever consciously used them in your screenwriting? Any thoughts on how they could be employed in our story, or whether it's even a good idea to try?",0.062,0.835,0.103,0.8743,pos

Sunset Five Miles High** There are a few times in life that offer the rare opportunity of an unobstructed perspective; being able to look back with gratitude at everything that has happened, while also looking forward at the future with acceptance. Like reaching the summit of a great mountain and being able to see the trail drop and meander on either side — at least that’s how I imagine it would be. I’ve never actually seen a mountain for myself, much less ever climb one. Like many others, I’ve spent the totality of my life within the city, specifically the lower three miles. The little I know of mountains, and every other aspect of life on earth, I’ve learned via hippocampus transmission in the library pods. That was before I was digitally exiled, before my synapse chip was removed. Many would reason that death would be an easier punishment, and at first I had accepted that logic with an unabated sense of despair. But then I learned what it meant to truly be alive; what life must have felt like all the thousands of years ago before humanity left earth. I have lived what can only be described as a true life, one that can only be experienced without a tether. It is with this knowledge, that I am able to face tomorrow with peace. For what is a true life, if it doesn’t end in a true death? The drawn out sunset warms my back as I sit atop the highest roof. At five miles above the surface of the ocean, the air is desperately thin and with each breath, the hairs in my nostrils momentarily freeze before thawing with the following exhale. The clouds never reach this high, they prefer to drift lazily halfway between myself and the garden rings. At this height, the neon glow of the under-city is nothing more than a soft glow in the fog. Soon the shadow of the horizon will finish its slow climb up the city, and I’ll be forced to take my writing inside. But for now I am content to feel the skin on my face go numb as I watch the stars grow in number in the blackening sky. I know it is unlikely at best, but the thought of my story being heard brings me hope. It’s a far fetched dream, but it’s just possible that my death tomorrow could be just the thing that saves humanity. **2. Beginnings** Any attempt to capture the entirety of a life on paper runs the risk of either being overburdened with superfluous detail, or being so barebones that every bit of nuance is lost. Both result in pages that are entirely unreadable. Since my desire is that the story of my life would inspire change, I must labor tirelessly and walk the razor thin line between the two options for failure. I was born in the year seventy three of the forty seventh century, Earth years that is. Which is, simply put, a mathematic approximation based on the gravitational time dilation, meaning if I could miraculously transport back to Earth I would be nearly three hundred years old at the time of writing this. But of course I can’t — no one can, which is why it baffles me that we still bother to use the Earth Standard Years system. Sure, it made sense when there was interstellar travel to and from the old planet, but that hasn’t been the case for nearly six hundred years. On planet Alpha Theta III, colloquially known as Hydrosphere, I’m fifty four. But I’m getting ahead of myself. My father was a nuclear thermal technician, and although he would often admit he was a glorified grease monkey, my mother would say he secretly liked how the title made him sound smarter than he probably was. My mother was a line cook for the same company, Interplanetary Humanity Corp. As with many of the labor divisions within the IHG, their days were long and filled with the type of work that makes muscles taught and bones ache. But despite this, my early years were in a home of joy, often filled with my father’s baritone singing accompanied by my mother softly humming a harmony. All these years later I can still hear my father’s voice when he would tell me about the day he fell in love. “It was the grayest of days and the fog was so thick it felt like walking through a curtain of water, but when I saw your mother it was like the sky was rent in two and the warmth of the sun came just for me. Her smile shone like the full moons, and her eyes twinkled more than the Epsilon Galaxy. In that moment time stood still.” “You’re just saying that because I gave you a double portion of breakfast after you sweet talked your way past my better judgement.” My mother interrupted. “You were the one with the ladle, you can’t blame a man for trying.” “I most certainly can! It was my first day, I wound up having extra cleaning duties for the whole month.” She retorted and feigned annoyance. “It was all part of my plan, how could you ignore the charming young man who then offered to help clean every night.” My father smiled and winked at her. “You’re slimier than can of sardines.” “But you love me for it.” Those early years of my life were certainly some of the best, looking back I can say with certainty that I had something that most children in the IHC labor housing district never got to experience: two parents that loved each other fiercely, and loved me unconditionally. That’s not to say that life was always easy, even as a young child I could see that it wasn’t. There seemed to always be unscheduled maintenance of a cooling unit or pump facility that needed immediate attention. And all too often my parents would return home late in the evening, exhausted to the point of near collapse. I can still clearly see my father coming home and choosing to sleep still wearing his led lined work cap. At the time I didn’t think much of it, I just figured it was comfortable. Now I can see it was the only way to keep the tether completely silent at night. For me, those early years were spent mostly alone. Six days a week I sat on the floor and watched the IHC sponsored hologram of an artificial teacher intelligence. It was lonely, but effective, and should be no surprise that most children found that the natural course of their education found them prepared to enter the workforce by age fifteen. An IHC job was eager waiting, of course. Despite the hardships of life, in my early childhood I grew up knowing love and joy in abundance. But as the Old Earth saying goes, ‘this too shall pass,’ and it certainly did. **3. Oranges** It was the morning of my eight birthday, which that year happened to fall on the one day of the week that my father didn’t go into work. As it was with most of the early mornings, the air was thick and heavy with fog. We donned our IHC branded neoprene jackets and pants, and with a final hug and wave to my mother, we left the flat for the blanketed silence of the morning fog. Like any young child on their birthday with a promise of a surprise, I was overflowing with excitement. It took all of my control to remain silent as we wove our way through the tight alleyways. Six months ago my father made me a promise, if I could make it until my birthday without getting sent home from school, he would have a big surprise for me. You see, the issue was that this was my first time going to school in an actual building — and I hated every second of it. It was hot and stuffy, and packed full with more people than I had ever seen. It was also the first time I had learned how mean other kids could be. There was a group of four brothers, all within three years of me, who would make it a game to see who could make me angry the fastest. The teasing would never stop, and as such, I spent many days learning from the virtual teacher. But with the promise of a surprise, I had held my tongue and temper for the longest six months of my eight year old life. We rounded one final corner and could now just make out the glow from the neon signs lining either side of the wide road. The metal grated road vibrated slightly under my boots, and my breath made small wisps of steam that quickly became lost amongst the fog. “Phoros, do you know why the lower three are covered in fog each morning?” My father asked me. “The city lowers to water the gardens during the night.” I replied, it was one of the lessons that I had actually found interesting. “Good, but tell me more. Do you know how it lowers?” This went well beyond anything that had been covered in my lessons so far. But as my father had suggested, I had made a habit of watching the older kid’s instruction on the other side of the room when I became bored with my own. As we waited for the door to the elevator to open, I closed my eyes and tried to picture the holo screen. “The hot tank keeps the city floating.” I said confidently, then paused to form the next thought. “During the night the city must release some of the heat to water the garden.” My father smiled and patted the top of my head. “Well done. It’s a little bit more complicated than that though. The generators produce a lot of extra heat, which we put in the hot tanks to keep us floating. But at night, the city doesn’t need as much power since most people are sleeping. That gives the generators a break, and the hot tanks start to cool.” He stopped talking to make sure I was understanding. “So instead of running the generators just to produce heat, the city dips further into the atmosphere and waters the gardens.” He finished. The elevator door opened and we stepped inside. My father told me which button to push, and I pushed it with the enthusiasm only an eight year old could have. “But where does the generators get the heat from?” I asked. “Ask it again, correctly this time.” “Where \*do\* the generators get the heat from?” It always frustrated me when he corrected me like that. He knew what I was trying to say, none of my other friends got corrected by their parents like that. “The generators get their heat from nuclear fission. But that’s a lesson for another day.” We travelled four floors higher before the doors opened and three other men stepped in. Their clothes were stained and they smelled like oil. One of the men held his hand against the security panel, which glowed while it scanned his palm before flashing a green checkmark in the corner. After selecting one of the two floors requiring security clearance, the man turned and greeted my father with a nod. ""Awfully early to be heading to the Grand Bazaar.” “It certainly would be. We’re heading topside.” My father replied. I had only been topside once before, and it was years ago so I barely remembered it. Now that I knew we were going again, I couldn’t help the excitement from growing within my little eight year old body. My father saw my wide eyes and gave me a wink. Five floors later, the elevator dinged and lurched to a stop. A pair of women stepped on, filling the elevator to shoulder to shoulder capacity. They were older than myself but far younger than my father who had grey hair beginning to climb up his sideburns. The woman on the right was about to select the second button on the final row, but stopped when she saw it was already glowing. She turned to me and waved while smiling with teeth that shone against her dark red lipstick. “\\\`Morning ladies.” The man to my right, who smelled of oil said, while lifting his cap slightly. “Oh drop the formalities Bennett, we all know the level of familiarity we share.” I could see that Bennett blushed, although at the time I didn’t know why. “Like I said to these gentlemen, it’s awfully early to be heading to the Grand Bazaar, shops won’t be open for another few hours.” The man who had nodded to my father said. When he talked he had a habit of scrunching his eyebrows together until they formed a single line. It reminded me of my father’s mustache. The woman waved her hand as if she were shooing away a moth. “Yes, yes. We’re going on business.” “We’ve been hired for a month long cruise. Our patron is from the upper fifth. Can you believe it? They’ve even sent for us to be fitted for custom garments.” The second woman said, interrupting the first. The man’s eyebrows remained touching as he sought for words. It reminded me of how some of my classmates looked when they were asked a question they didn’t know. “It appears that our patron has very specific tastes that require something a little more unique than our normal \*work outfit.\*” The first woman finished saying. Bennett blushed again right as the elevator slowed. Once it dinged, and the doors opened, the women departed. We followed, exiting the elevator and entering into the Grand Bazaar. It beautiful and full of magic in my childhood mind in ways that can only be replicated by the stars of the galaxy. Neon lights shone through the morning fog as we walked through the wide street. “Father, why isn’t there any wind here?” “Good question, why do you think?” I wasn’t in the mood for any more thinking or pondering. It was still the early morning and I was tired. “I don’t know, I guess that’s just the way IHC wanted it to be.” I responded curtly. My father chuckled, hearing his own answer for questions when he was too exhausted to explain. “Exactly, sometimes there aren’t clear answers to things.” At the time, his response did nothing more than briefly fan the sparks of a foul mood, and being the perceptive father he was, he quickly diverted my attention back to the surprise birthday adventure at hand. But in the sobering acceptance of lost opportunities that hindsight often requires, I find myself deeply wishing that I could go back and ask my father what caused him to think that way. As I write this, I know — or at least I have my suspicions, so I suppose what I would wish for most, would be the opportunity to tell him that it will all be okay. That I love him. And that I understand. —————————— At the center of the Grand Bazaar stood the IHC speed tube. It rose from floor to ceiling and was almost completely covered in LCD screens that must have been at least twenty feet high. In the still dim bazaar, the tower shone bright enough to make me squint my eyes. As we continued to approach, a larger than life woman faded onto the screen. In a somber yet calm tone she began describing some event that I was unaware of. She mostly used words that were bigger than I knew. “It is with IHC’s deepest condolences that we inform our family, friends, and coworkers of the tragic event that unfolded yesterday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, surface probe alpha lost structural rigidity. The six IHC workers experienced a painless departure…” The voice in the speakers faded into the background as we entered through the automatic sliding doors. “What is she talking about? What does ‘unforeseen circumstances’ mean?” I asked as my father took my hands and pulled me into a brisk walk. “I’ll tell you when you’re older.” My father replied, his eyes were sweating again. “But today’s my birthday, I am older.” “I suppose you are.” He smiled at me, and blinked his eyes a few times. “But what the woman on the screen is talking about isn’t something fit for a birthday. Come on, we need to get our tickets.” I had almost forgotten, we were heading topside. The automated ticketing booth scanned my face and processed for a few seconds before showing a green check. A few moments later we were seated in a near empty transport tube. “Why didn’t it scan your face?” “It doesn’t need to, it scanned my access token when we walked through the door.” “Oh, and your access token is in your head?” “Exactly, it’s like a fingerprint, but for each synapse chip. It’s the same thing that allows your mother to pay for our food for the week.” Before I could respond, a friendly voice came over the speakers. It thanked us for choosing the IHC Expressway Tube, and then told us to remain seated for the duration of the ascent. “Remember, clench your stomach when we accelerate.” My father said. I hardly heard him over the excitement in my own mind. When the tube started rising I felt my stomach sink towards my seat. As we picked up more speed my head began to grow heavy and it was hard to keep my eyes open. The sensation only lasted a few seconds though before we were traveling at a constant speed. By the time I was growing bored, likely only a minute or so, the tube began to slow. I moved my arms in front of me and laughed at the few moments of near weightlessness as it felt like my butt was lifting off the chair and my arms felt lighter than a feather. Once we were stationary, the curved door dinged and slid into the recess in the tube. I held my breath as the light poured in. I knew I had seen it once before, but that was when I was much younger. Now having just turned a year older, I gazed upon the beauty of the topside with a new sense of appreciation. If The Lowers was like night, Topside was day in all of its brilliance. We exited the tube, and walked out into the sprawling courtyard. The air felt light and was surprisingly crisp and chilly. Despite the warmth of the sun, I found myself shivering while my breath made little puffs of clouds. “Come on, it will be warmer in the gardens.” With wide eyes and braille bumps on my arms, I followed my father onto the moving sidewalk. We walked towards the first green ring as the world around us sped past as if we were running; vibrant hues of the softest of greens became a blur and the cool air became wind against my face. The colors here were gentle, like a soft pillow. For those who have lived their life exclusively in the Lowers or Topside, it’s hard to find words to express the contrast in ways that would allow you to understand the depth of differences. It’s not as simple as ‘Lowers is poor, Topside is rich’ which is true in all meanings, but fails to include the nuance required. And to simply say that Lowers is dark, and Topside is light fails to account for all the other senses. Lowers is best described as the contents underneath a kitchen sink, crammed and overlapping, and with the constant noise echoing from the underside of the divider. While topside is best described as a lily being gently brushed by the wind; peaceful, serine, and joy inducing. The difference caused my eyes and mind to squint from shock. I lurched forward as my first step off the moving sidewalk caught all the momentum of my eight year old body. At this point my teeth were chattering as my father lifted me into his arms and carried me the remaining brisk walk to the garden. The entrance was a tunnel of sorts, with a door on both ends. I had expected to see another face scanner, but there was none and the door rotated open as we approached. Inside the tube was plain and boring, with reminders written on the inside stating that charges get automatically deducted once something has been picked. That was followed by smaller writing saying something along the lines of contacting customer assistance for any disputes — I didn’t finish sorting through the meaning because once the outer door closed behind us, a bell chimed and the air began to cycle. The warm and humid air descended like a blanket as the cold air fled through vents in the floor. My father lowered me from his arms, back on my feet, and rubbed his hands against my arms to chase away the final remnants of chill. The inner door opened once the air cycle had completed, and what lay beyond was better than I could have possibly hoped for. As I later learned in school, one of the many benefits of a climate controlled greenhouse is the ability to maintain perpetual growing seasons. But for an eight year old on his birthday, the garden in full bloom with every type of fruit imaginable was simply magic that had been worked just for me. The air smelled sweet and felt thick from all the colors. Red, blue, green, purple, and yellow were represented without reserve. “Pick your favorite, and we’ll try it together.” My father told me as he took my hand and led me along the sidewalk that meandered through the beauty. How was I supposed to pick? There were countless fruits that I didn’t know the names of, and some even that I had never even seen a photo of, much less with my own eyes. How was I possibly going to pick a favorite when I had never tasted a real piece of fruit in my life? That was the question that had been rattling around in my head, but upon seeing their beauty, it was a question no longer. They were larger than both my fists put together, and shone with an orange glow that seemed brighter than the sun. My father lifted me into the air so I could pull one from the tree. It was far heavier than I had expected and I held it tightly as not to let it drop and escape. “Oh please can we get two? We can take them back and share with Mom. It will help her feel better, I know if I was sick it would make me feel better.” My father smiled at me and lifted me to pick another. —————————— That night as I lay in bed daydreaming of eating another orange and waiting for sleep to come, I overheard one of the few times my parents argued. “It was expensive enough to even go topside. We can’t afford two, you know that.” “I know my love, but you should have seen his face. How was I supposed to tell him no? He asked for a second one because he wanted to share it with you.” “You’ve already said that, but how are we going to pay for it?” “The reactor cleanup team has a temporary spot opening after the mantel accident. I’ll pick up a few extra shifts until it’s covered. I’ll figure it out, trust me.” My mother sighed. “I know you will, you always do. I just don’t have much time left and I don’t want you to spend it working extra so I can have a bite of fruit.” As I lay in bed and tried to understand what my mother had meant I could just faintly hear the sound of crying. I couldn’t tell if it was my father or mother.",0.05,0.813,0.138,0.9999,pos

Overpowered MC if he uses his brain to leverage advantages, not just raw strength. Danny Lastname and his brother, Joey Lastname, are trying to live their best life after tragedy took thier dad from them a few years ago. Things were going pretty well, all things considered. They had jobs, cars, hobbys, and shared an apartment to save up money for their own houses one day. Like everyone else on the planet, however, all that work was for nothing when a mysterious ball of mana powerleveled every living entity on the planet straight to level 25. Combine that with the systems usual bonus multiplyer, meant to give people just a couple bonus levels to help get started, and now everyone on the planet is roughly level 25-200, depending on the multiplyer. In typical fashion, Danny's luck is as good as it is bad, and our hero ended up having the maximum level possible for the multiverse, but cant learn any magic, and has to get bumped down to level 1 because of his Prestige Class, Inventory Mage. Hes left with an immense aura that he cant use, a maximum level inventory with pretty insane capabilities, and a level 1 prestige class that takes 350x the exp to level up. Unlike other mages, all of Dannys magic must come from mana and cores in his inventory. He cannot form his own cores, so he has to figure out how to use collected ones from the wildlife thats constantly trying to eat him for his insane aura. On the first night, little brother Joeys body explodes like roughly 50% of everyone else in the world when he tries using magic for the first time, completely overloading his mana pathways with magic way beyond his bodys acclimation. Luckily his power is to possess vehicles, so his soul was saved, but now hes trapped inside of their old rally car. He can transfer his soul to another vehicle at any time, but it will take great magic to make him a new body. Joeys talent, Upgrade Vehicle, allows him to make any upgrades he can think of as long as he has the materials. Danny and Joey find an abandoned shipyard, and get the idea to use ""Upgrade Vehicle"" on a massive carrier ship still under construction, the USS Enterprise. after collecting every scrap of metal at the shipyard and placing it on the unfinished decks of the carrier, Joey used his talent and upgrades it, making it flight capable and fully completed with tons of added features. This ship will serve as the ""main base"" of the party for the rest of the series. Sister Eleanor, a nun from chicago, was another recipient of a high bonus multiplyer. She is currently the Highest level of all humanity. Before this all happened, she was already a genius, after the comet her intellect became uncalculatable, scaling beyond the standard IQ metric. She took control of the entire worlds internet, infrastructure, military, weapons system, communications, and power grids within minutes of leaving the introductions. She basically forces the world to play nice and focus on survival, and has set up Chicago to be the last bastion of hope for humanity. She did this by designing 12 Mech suits that look like nuns (Nundams?) that she and 11 others use to patrol chicago and its borders, enforcing the peace, and keeping the wildlife back. along with hordes of other inventions and bots designed to help, powered by ambient mana. Trust that the Nundam suits are epic and awesome, powered by portals and turbo engines, to avoid any potential emp or digital attacks. She stays in Chicago to watch over humanity, not joining the party, but is involved heavily. TJ was a former CIA operative turned farmer. His power is rebirth, coming back to life in a new body in a burst of golden energies that he can direct as weapons for a short period of time after regeneration. his power seems to have no limits or fuel source. Hes the wise old man of the party, the veteran. The forge has the power to make/create anything inanimate. Anything he has touched or thought of since gaining his class, he can recreate from mana. This includes magical items like cores and fractals. He combines magical items with technology. This guy makes the weapons and armor for the team to use, his contributions to the team are obvious. Hes also the only person Danny and Joey know from life before the system. Sister Abigaile (Abi) Her power is teleportation or portals, like all the nuns. It is required to run the suits with an external fuel source located in a facility. She was sent to ""Spy"" on mc and his party, to make clear his intentions with the USS Enterprise. She ends up reporting back and deciding to stay with the party, with Sister Eleanors permission. Possible LI for MC if I'm up to the challenge of writing romance. Her use for the team is a powerful frontline fighter. The Nerds power is quantification. His eyes are like black holes, and he can gain almost all info on anything he sees. he is also almost as smart as Sister Eleanor. His main addition to the team is strategy and recon. Chicago is currently under massive construction by armies of automated bots, converting it into a flying City-ship that will eventually be space capable and Earths first Mothership. This will be the main setting for later books in the series. for now its the setting of a large part of book one, act 2. All of the wildlife on the planet was powerleveld with mana, not just Humans. Everything is now huge and hungry and deadly. Most lifeforms also have developed a fractal, usually pertaining to what its known for. Turtles project a sheild, Opossums ""play dead"" and have a second life, ants have a ""Link fractal"" and the queen has a ""Sync fractal"" allowing for perfect control of the swarm. you get the idea. Dungeons have opened up all over the planet, promising system rewards for any who can close them. The only problem is that most people cant use thier magic safely yet, so the dungeons just get stronger, and the rewards increase. That about sums it up. Thank you if you read all that up to this point. Im not asking anyone to write the synopsis or blurb for me, just maybe point out what info would go well in them, maybe point out stuff thats good for a blurb or synopsis, and stuff i should leave for discovery in the book. I assume blurb and synopsis have seperate criteria for usefull information.",0.042,0.797,0.161,0.9994,pos

A short story Hello all, I am writing a few chapters for a short story. All of which can be found in my profile. I am open to critique. **CHAPTER III — Masked Virtuoso** Popularity is strange. You don’t notice it building until people start talking about you like they know you. Naturally, word of me started slow. Mentions on music boards, short clips circulating through feeds. People deemed my performances “unreal,” “phenomenal.” I wanted to take that as praise, nonetheless it was, but the word *unreal* stuck with me. It meant fake. Soon, comments changed tone. *If he’s so good, why won’t he perform live?* *Probably generated.* *Another faker.* I tried to ignore them, but they started to grow on me. Every song I released brought another wave of doubt. Some said I didn’t exist. Others said I did, but wasn’t human. And maybe, in some ways, they were right. My virtual identity had become part of me. Online, I could stand in front of thousands with pride. When people accused me, I didn’t fight back. I let my name defend itself. The music was proof enough, I told myself. But late at night, their words stuck like static in my ears. If no one sees your face, do they ever really believe you’re there? When you fall in a forest, and there’s nobody around, do you ever really crash or even make a sound? At first, I thought the criticism would fade, that my work would speak louder than their noise. But it didn’t. The numbers grew, the comments multiplied, and with them came the same endless questions. Some wanted to interview me. Others demanded proof. A few sent threats—empty ones, maybe, but enough to make me keep me on edge. The threads discussed everything about me. My tone, my phrasing, the faint imperfections in my recordings. They compared my voice to real singers, models, to programs, to digital clones, even promptly generated tunes. They slowed down my songs, listened for anything relatively robotic, and posted their findings like they’d uncovered a crime. I told myself I didn’t care. But the more they talked, the more I started to listen. I began questioning myself. Were my songs too clean? Too measured? Perhaps I was using too much reverb. I’d replay recordings, searching for traces of something artificial. It’s ironic how the very technology that let me be myself was now being used as proof that I wasn’t real. One night, during a live session, someone typed into the chat: “Show your face or stop pretending you’re human.” I froze. My hands gripping onto the microphone. The crowd waited—thousands of avatars suspended in motion. I ended the stream without saying a word. The next day, the clip went viral. People called it proof that I was hiding something. Some said that the fact I froze after hearing such a compelling request, proves that I was real. Others said it was performance art, maybe a symbol for identity. I wasn’t sure which version of me they were more interested in—the singer or the secret. I avoided the stage for about a week after that. While roaming around the streets, and hanging out at my home, I thought about what people could be spouting about me online. When I finally logged back in, the platform felt different. The space that had once felt like a refuge now carried something heavy. I could feel their eyes—digital or not—watching for a slip. Waiting for me to prove them right. So I adapted. I leaned into the mystery. I’ll turn a mask into a symbol. My light went darker. My performances longer, quieter, more deliberate. My principle was “Talk less, smile more.” It worked. The critics called it “artful restraint.” The fans called it “iconic.” No one saw it for what it really was—fear, dressed up as poise. But fame doesn’t erase fear. It feeds it. Offers came in—collaborations, sponsors, cameos. People wanted to bring The Maestro into the real world. They wanted me to perform *live.* Every invitation was a test. Every stage, a reminder of the one thing I couldn’t do. I turned them all down, one by one, with polite excuses and promises I never intended to keep. Then came the journalists. They wanted stories, not songs. They dug through records, traced usernames, searched for anything that could lead to me. And somewhere in that noise, there was something off. They weren’t after The Maestro anymore. They wanted me.",0.087,0.841,0.072,-0.9088,neg

However, especially with AI, I'm a little skeptical about it, especially since my main focus is 2d illustration. I have some questions that I would really appreciate it if someone on the market could anwser for me: 1 - How's the demand with AI around? How many comisions do you get a month on average? (I know it is extremely variable, but it would be nice to have an idea) 2 - Sorry for the very personal question, but how much can you make on average? (I'm not american, so if I could get around 800 dollars a month that would be already enough to get a very comfortable life for me). 3 - Are you afraid that AI will take your job? Even if it can't do everything artists can, a lot of people rather use AI than hire someone, so despite everything, it would still hurt the market. 4 - Where do you sell your art? I've seen a lot of different sites but I have no idea which ones are good and which are not. Anyways, sorry for the long text, but I would really appreciate it if someone on the market could anwser at least a few of my questions, because I didn't really find good information on the internet so far.",0.057,0.841,0.102,0.9419,pos

More aesthetic customization options for substacks than for subreddits 3. The ability to edit titles 4. Notes that are like Substack's tweets, which can be much longer than tweets and are editable and seem great for cross-platform visibility 5. Live community chats where audience and contributors alike can create their own threads 6. Better UI 7. Far fewer errors on the server end 8. Not only is the user agreement more robust and protective of creators' IP, ensuring they won't sell posts to AI for profit without creators' consent, but there is also a button that can be toggled on that blocks posts from third parties looking to train AI without consent. 9. Ability to turn on payment options on one's own Substack, with the lion's share (90%) of profits going to the creator 10. While it requires a couple more steps to post on another Substack (must have a contributor invite from the owner or one of the Substack's admins), posting on another Substack looks cleaner and more professional than posting on a Reddit community. 11.

This might be one of the smartest product and marketing moves the design industry has seen in decades. Design creation is changing, again, forever. When I was studying design, computers were the new thing. I learned the traditional way: real drawing boards, pens, rulers, and drafting tables. It was exciting. Nobody wanted to use the cold, limited, and “soulless” computers of the time. Yet deep down, everyone knew there was no turning back. Sooner or later, we’d all have to learn how to design digitally. The impact was massive. And now, we’re facing a similar shift. We hesitate to embrace AI tools, but the change is inevitable. Why spend three hours removing a background when it can be done in three seconds? Why buy or rent props for a photo shoot when you can generate them in five seconds? Why build an entire set to photograph a model in a specific outfit when you can create it in ten seconds, with no logistics, staff, or time costs? And the list goes on… We don’t have official numbers on AI adoption in tools like Photoshop, but it’s happening. Maybe today 5% of designers use AI regularly. In five years, that number might be 20%, or 60%, or 90%. And Canva knows this very well. So, how will Affinity survive? Well, I don’t know anyone who still works professionally the old analog way. But I do know of professionals that are still using Photoshop 6, or other legacy tools, perfectly happy because they meet their needs.

I got an automated confirmation of date and time (and I paid in full at this time as well). After a few weeks, I sent an email asking her if the location worked or if she had another idea. I did not receive a reply until 3 weeks later, 15 minutes after my fiancé called her (to which she didn’t pick up the phone). Right before the session, I called her because we couldn’t find her. She immediately texted that she was running late (by about 5 minutes). We made it through the session, and we let her know there was no huge rush, and she told us she would have previews within a week, and everything done within two weeks. After a week and a half went by, I texted her on a Wednesday and asked for an update on when we could expect previews. She then responded the next Monday and apologized that it was taking her awhile, but she would have them done by the weekend. I texted her again after the weekend asking for a new update since clearly she didn’t finish before the weekend. She has since posted other sessions that are dated after our session on her website.

Two years ago a question was posted on this sub, *Why did CCD sensors become extinct? Rolling shutter sucks...* u/Rambalac asserted that ""CCD has rolling shutter as well"" and that old consumer cameras did not feature global shutter. He claimed that if a camera does not have global shutter in its specs, it does not have global shutter, ""otherwise there would be no reason to have mechanical shutter."" I googled around and I could not find a single example of a CCD sensor with rolling shutter. In particular: A 2012 whitepaper from ThermoFisher states that CCD only use global shutter: >**Global shuttering, the only imaging mode available for CCD cameras**, exposes each row of pixels to simultaneously expose for the same amount of time and at the same time. The use of global shutter is ideal for both dynamic and fixed sample imaging. Global shuttering is also available for some sCMOS cameras, but at the cost of higher noise and a slower speed. A 2013 whitepaper from ThorLabs states the following in relation to a particular sensor family: >DCU cameras have state-of-the-art CCD sensors while the DCC models are CMOS based. The CMOS models use either the global or the rolling shutter method; **the CCD models use only the global shutter method**. ChatGPT produced the following summary, hinting that interline-transfer CCD may produce rolling-like artifacts: |Sensor Type|Typical Shutter Type|Notes| |:-|:-|:-| |**Full-frame CCD**|**Global shutter**|Entire frame is exposed at once; mechanical shutter often used.| |**Frame-transfer CCD**|**Global shutter**|Charge transferred rapidly to a masked area for readout; exposure is simultaneous.| |**Interline-transfer CCD**|**Global shutter (usually)**|Uses vertical storage registers beside each column; often electronic shutter. Some older or low-cost designs can show *rolling-like artifacts* if readout overlaps exposure.| |**CMOS sensors**|**Rolling shutter (commonly)**|Each row exposed sequentially; can cause distortion with fast motion.| When asked, how rolling-like artifacts can happen, it explained that even though the exposure phase is global, the readout phase is sequential, and this is where artifacts can sneak in. But it is not true rolling shutter, because, * In a true rolling shutter (like most CMOS sensors) each row starts and stops its exposure at a slightly different time. This causes geometric distortions — e.g., skewed vertical lines, wobbly motion. * In an Interline-CCD all rows start and stop exposure together, so object geometry is preserved. Any “rolling-like” artifact is caused by imperfect shuttering, light leakage, or timing overlap — not intentional row-by-row exposure. My question to those who claim that CCD can employ rolling shutter: **name a CCD sensor, past or present, that uses rolling shutter. Even better, provide a link.**",0.049,0.929,0.022,-0.8251,neg

Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice on which device makes more sense for my workflow – a Mini PC or a Windows handheld (ROG Ally / Legion Go / MSI Claw). 💡 My situation I want a compact Windows computer that I can toss in a backpack if I ever need to move. I’m not looking for a laptop – I already have a fixed workspace when I’m working, and if I travel I’ll either use a monitor there or temporarily hook up my Android tablet as a display. Peripherals (keyboard, mouse) are not a problem; I bring them when needed. ⚙️ What I need it for Browsing, office tasks. Video editing: right now on ClipMaker (because my current laptop is weak), but I’d like to start using DaVinci Resolve simply because I like how it looks and the features. Input: 4K 60fps footage from iPhone. Output: ideally 4K 60fps, but 1080p 60fps is acceptable if 4K export demands much stronger hardware. I don’t plan heavy colour-grading—just cuts, transitions, zooms, etc. 🖥️ Options I’m considering Mini PCs (Windows) in the ~CAD 1,000 range or under: Beelink SEI14 – Intel Core Ultra 5 125H (14C/18T), 32 GB DDR5, 1 TB NVMe. MINISFORUM AI X1-255 – Ryzen 7 255 (8C/16T, up to 4.9 GHz), 32 GB DDR5, 1 TB SSD. I like the form-factor and don’t mind needing an external monitor/keyboard/mouse. Windows handhelds (same ~CAD 1,000 ballpark, many versions available so you can find good deals): ASUS ROG Ally Lenovo Legion Go MSI Claw With a dock + external monitor, these can function like a mini-PC, and you get the added bonus of doing some casual gaming from the couch. (I already have an Xbox and rarely play, but if I can hop into a match on the handheld, that’s a nice extra.) Bonus mention: I’m also aware of the Apple Mac Mini (M4, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) at a similar price. I’m keeping it as a fallback only if Windows options turn out to be clearly inferior—but I much prefer working in Windows so I don’t want to give that up without good reason. 🎯 My key question Which device will perform better for light-video editing in real-world usage — focusing on stability, smooth playback, render times in DaVinci/ClipMaker?

But the effort-to-traffic ratio is kinda rough? Creating pins takes time and algorithm changes are brutal. Still doing it but not my main focus anymore. Direct/organic social (15%) - random IG stories, TikTok reposts. Nothing crazy. What flopped: Facebook groups - waste of time. Guest posting myself - got maybe 2 acceptances out of 40+ pitches.

As people using AI to contribute to their blog continues to grow I thought I would do a refresher for that topic here. Blogging with AI can involve generating topics and headlines, content, images and infographics, to video and audio like podcasts. Google provide AI overviews that summarise information on its SERP's directly, without a click to content creators from which the information came, limiting organic traffic to blogs more. As a positive to this, that same tool can also be used as an efficient research tool. At its core, AI content and media is at a stage where it's being trained heavily. Once training has become more complete, AI media, or images specifically, used for blogs will have much more originality compared to AI content. This is because while both AI images and AI content are interpreted from text input, the output for images are pixels, whereas the output for text is confined to more text, or dictionary words. To further this representation, as our interpretation of dictionary words as humans into grammar, structured sentences, etc, that we learn growing up and throughout our life are misrepresented when people use AI produced content for their blog posts, is the reason I don't copy AI content to my blog. Having said that, AI media is dangerous. It can generate lifelike videos or images that are completely fake and deceive and mislead the original media and how accurately that media will appear to be real will only evolve. Making the most of AI by generating media such as infographics for your blog and using AI as a research tool to contribute to your blog can take it to the next level and give it more comprehensive coverage of a topic than what a single SERP can provide, improving your niche blog's authority.",0.028,0.9,0.072,0.8913,pos

Early this year she started to criticize and harass me constantly. I was assigned to take over a legacy project after the previous owner left but havn't done anything yet. She is an user of this project. One day she sent an email saying this project does not work as she said she consulted chatgpt and the chatgpt said it does not work. Interestingly the project is a proprietary algorithm which is never published and it is impossible for chatgpt to know the details. The other day she also sent an email questioning why the algo works this way. I answered this is because the upstream project changed. She kept saying this is wrong until I pulled in another coworker who told her she needs to better understand this project and the upstream projects. On a side note, she seems to have a mental health issue. One day we had a town hall, and in the end she said loudly why everyone was laughing. The fact was that no one was laughing. Several coworkers noticed this and asked me if I knew anything was wrong. In the week afterwards, she disappeared from work for a week. As for my manger, he knows this but never did anything.

I know it hasn’t been long, but hear me out. I am working at a very large, Fortune 50 corporation that is extremely competitive to get into. I landed two professional internships there during my stint in college (Bachelors of Business Management), and was able to get a job offer from there. This was a dream company for me and objectively, I have zero reason to be unhappy. The pay out of college is stellar, more than anybody in my entire life has ever made, and I couldn’t be more grateful, especially in this devastatingly bad job market. The benefits are also great due to this company’s brand power. I feel an insane amount of guilt, shame, and disappointment in myself for how I feel about my job. I feel like I have no right to feel this way when there are people that would 100% kill for it. It’s a desk job in finance. I work in a corporate office in a very small team that is given more work than it probably can handle. It is known to be a very difficult role but they thought I could handle it after I had success in my internship (note: due to size of this company, my internships were in completely different areas than this). I work 10-11 hour days, usually skip lunches, go in early and leave late, and am constantly struggling even though I do my best to go above and beyond every day. I don’t get along very well with my team. They’re not bad people, there is just a heavy mismatch of personality and management style. It is composed of just myself, my manager, and another person. My manager is very intense, work-focused, logical, and cold. For the first two months, I would go home about 50% of the time crying because she was so condescending and intimidating that I felt like a failure and was afraid of meetings with her. This was apparently an issue with previous individuals in my role. I ended up talking to another manager about it due to how much it was impacting me (and at the suggestion of my predecessor of this role). It has since improved some, but a lot of it is just how she is as a person (although she means well). In my end of year review, she gave positive feedback, which I appreciated, although I really am struggling to feel like I belong. She is micromanagey and nitpicky as well. She picks apart my messages, wants me to communicate every single task I work on and finish at all times, and rephrase the things I say to how she would say it. I always have an insane amount of work to do and since week one, I’ve felt like I’m constantly drowning and overwhelmed. I’ve tried to communicate this but I’m told this is how the team is, that my manager/peer are taking on a lot on their plate to keep me in a bubble from even more work, and that I will need to do 3 times more work within the next few months so I need to be more efficient. It makes me feel bad for feeling as stressed and overwhelmed as I do, since they’re doing even more than me and are trying to guardrail me from more. They’ve worked hard to try to help me and train me, but I’m realizing that this really doesn’t seem to be an entry-level-suited role. I don’t enjoy what I do. It doesn’t give me fulfillment or satisfaction. I’m learning that business and finance as a whole feels like it doesn’t fit me, but now I’m lost, because I don’t know what does. I still go into work every day with a smile, do my absolute best, ask questions, take tons of notes, communicate very heavily. I succeeded in school and in my internships, but this role has been a rude awakening (and from what I can tell from other new recruits, isn’t a universal experience). It has hit me hard. I went straight into working after I graduated. I’m 1000 miles from home, I have limited/no contact with my parents, and I don’t have almost any savings (I graduated with basically zero money, this job saved me). I feel like I wake up, go to a job I don’t like, never get enough work done, stay as late as I can before I am burnt out, go home, do chores, and sleep to repeat it. I have to give myself pep talks to go to work each day. I feel like a husk of myself. I feel like I’m so young, it’s dumb I feel this way. And even more so, I feel I have no control over this portion of my life, which is currently almost all of my life. Don’t get me wrong - I try my best to make friends, do hobbies, spend my time outside of work doing things, leave work at the office. But it still feels like work is one giant day that bleeds together, and my brain can’t decompress from the heaviness and intensity of my job. If I actually enjoyed it or could be myself with my team, I think I’d feel better. I’ve told myself for months to keep trying since I’m so new, that I don’t want to be rash and want to give it time. But I don’t know, my gut is telling me that even though this is a good job for many people, it simply isn’t for me. Just walking into the office sucks all the energy out of me. Now I feel stuck. I’ve kept this to myself because so many people have believed in me, are proud that I got this job… my school even did articles about me for having achieved the role. I feel like I’m supposed to be happy. I have a dream salary at a dream company, I don’t have to worry about any of the things so many people need to. I feel like a baby, and a brat, and tell myself to suck it up and get over it. But instead I just feel worse. And I can’t leave, I simply can’t. I can’t afford it, I have nowhere to go, and I’d be severing ties with this company in a way that I wouldn’t want to. But I feel like I’m at a stalemate where I so badly want to quit but feel I can’t. What should I do? Am I crazy?",0.113,0.741,0.147,0.9906,pos

Thanks to all the Redditors who helped me along the way. I applied to the job on Sept. 29, 2025. It was the 38th application out of 65. Looking at my journal, I see that was the day I created the theory of scanning as a natural behavior to feel safe (think having a nice view while you work). I came up with this by befriending a German Shepherd and her coyote friends at the park and noticing how the coyotes looked very relaxed while out in the open. I also wrote a short fictional story about two friends, one who wants to go to the bar and the other who has been stabbed. The story involves two characters, one who is desperately searching for a job (metaphorically stabbed and bleeding out) and the one who wants to go to the bar is their comfortably retired parents. There are no notes about the company I applied to and found a job with - it's just an ad I responded to that day. I was obviously taking time to walk in the park, read books (Piano Player, Kurt Vonnegut) and do some writing to express my frustration with the job search. At that time I was going through my skill list in the morning, looking for angles. Then doing ChatGPT searches based on descriptions. However, the relevant job ad did not come from a ChatGPT search. It was simply from searching for the occupation involving my undergrad degree (chemist) in Indeed.com. Asking the LLM to search for similar jobs did not work, it just returned postings requiring PhD and other useless stuff. I didn't use the LLM to generate this cover letter or resume. However, the cover letter and resume were modified manually from responses to a similar ad. ChatGPT did help draft those. I made a mistake in the manual modification of the cover letter, using the city from the other posting. I was going for volume and speed and in the end the mistake didn't matter. There are a few comments I have to make on the process and character: - The company was interested in me and respectful from the beginning. Their process started with emails to schedule a real video call with the manager, then in person interview, some time to decide and check references (I gave other engineers and technical people) then an offer letter. The manager managed - they spent a lot of time talking to me and interviewing me. Competing processes that involved one way interviews or HR personel screening calls turned out to be a waste of time. This manager has been with the company since it was quite small. - I responded quickly to their messages, which were all sent during the working day. I arrived a bit early to the interview and that was useful because I had a chance to look at their machines. They did not park me in an empty reception, but amongst some machines to look at. - They seemed to appreciate the fact that I repair my own car. This is in fact how my father also secured his first 'real job'. This job does involve repair and support of machines. The success here also echos the advice a professor once gave me, ""get some HPLC experience and you'll never be out of a job"" (Thank you Dr. Oleschuk!). - This is a company that started from a father/son team and they asked me about my family origin. It is similar (three generations of scientists) and they seemed to appreciate that. - I noticed that facilities were used efficiently for this company of about 30 people. There were no empty offices or wasted spaces. Another company I interviewed with, which apparently had no money to hire me, were spending their money on empty desks, big lounges and mostly unused conference rooms. Throughout the process I gradually gained a good feeling about the company and began to look at them not as a 'random' but someone serious about doing some good work. They gained my confidence and I signed the job offer on the day it was sent.",0.048,0.854,0.098,0.9895,pos

How will they know if I got fired or not especially if I show two references from the company and have them put in a good word for me.

To make matters worse, my dad suffered a second stroke this year on 10/20) which is what promoted me to write follow up email. This worries me as I hadn’t heard anything from my manager since February in regards my situation and request. Furthermore, from two coworkers, I have heard that my manager has made talk about my vacation time not being approved yet, which I find unprofessional. I do not know what she said exactly. But from my understanding one coworker heard it and told two others (who I am more close with) told me- but nothing has been disclosed to me from my manager. Based off all this - I sent a polite and professional follow up email, hoping to get clarification. Her response was short, and that she wanted to talk in her office one day this week. This is not the response I was expecting and leads me to believe some not to positive conversation. I am expecting 3 possibilities to occurs: 1. She just wants to verify the days I put in (asking for 5 shifts off giving me 12/22 - 1/5 off) and verify PTO 2. Deny PTO with An ultimatum that I would have to take FMLA or leave of absence instead 3. Deny the request altogether So today, I was at work from some training and after it ended I went to her office. Another coworker was there and she said she’d be with me in a minute. Maybe 20 minutes go by. I go to check and the educator is in there. I wait for a total of 45 min and at 9:58 receive a text that states “I have a meeting at 1000, we can talk one day this week”. I’m frustrated with this response. No apologies for spending my time on my day off (aside education) waiting. I went home. I plan to have the conversation tomorrow. I am so nervous and anxious over this whole situation. I’ve used chatGPT for some leading statements to help me navigate this. But any other insight and advice is so greatly appreciated.",0.079,0.885,0.036,-0.9555,neg

This may not be the place but i'm so frustrated with ai and the current job market. I have a background in forensics accounting and auditing. My contract for a job that I've been with for 10 months ended in July 2025, before that I was laid off from a big accounting firm. Since I've been through a job ending early before this time it felt easy. I said thank you, and started applying. A week later I was on teams with a man from a small company for a forensic accounting role. During that time on teams, a profile was also up called Read.ai, it was my first time seeing this and wasn't bothered by it. Shortly after the interview I received an email from read.ai that breaks down how the meeting went and the highlights. I didnt get the job so I moved on. I had a couple more interviews after that but mainly used the teams web instead of the app. There was one interview where i should have used the app because the screen share was really blurry so by the next interview, I went back on the teams app. A big mistake. It was an interview with Autonation, a managerial role. I was excited and driven. The recruiter loved my resume to the point where he had me interview a week before the others. Confident I was going to get it I put my best foot forward. During the first interview, the guy asks what is the profile that is in our meeting, knowing that I saw read.ai before i shortly explain that he has it up and he then remove the profile showing just us. The interview was short with his last question being "" do you have experience in AI"" i confirm as I dabbled a bit in AI, even taking an oracle course because i wanted to learn more but that’s where my experience with Ai stops. The 2nd interview was a little longer but still weird, the read.ai profile was up and the 2nd guy went through the interview with no problem. The interview ended with me being upset at myself for stumbling on a few SQL questions. The next day, the recruiter called me to tell me that i didn’t get the job. I then said, I figured since I made some mistake on the sql questions. The recruiter told me that the two managers didn’t feel comfortable moving forward cause i used AI. I was shock and confused, my heart racing because I've never cheated in college much less cheating to get a job. He explained that the read.ai put the summary in the teams chat and also email everyone that did the interview and it was actually coming from my end. i explained that I never used it and its a feature within teams. using read.ai would have never benefit me seeing that its B2B software. I explained that and how it got on my computer. i even emailed him all the evidence supporting me not using it. he didn’t want to hear it. The job market is already terrible and a company thinking I’m using ai is just put me in a weird spot. Now im more hyper aware of messages that comes to me and I deleted all and everything read.ai.

I know every system has it's issues, but I need people to commiserate at just how bad office processes can be. Short background - It's a B2B/inside sales role, a lot of boomer customers who don't even know what materials they need to perform their own trade they've been practicing for 30+ years with a few very professional companies who have their sh*t together sprinkled in. Here's the list: Order entry: Microsoft Great Plains that hasn't been relevant or updated since 2010. It's being phased out in the next 2 years. Almost nothing set up on the back end. Wading through ancient part numbers that are no longer in inventory is constant. It took 6 months of me asking to delete sample books that no longer exist so I could stop spending dozens if minutes tracking things down. Items that are sold at both individual and bulk quantities are ONE part number, so I have to open a separate window and pull up a drop-down menu to confirm the quantity. NOTHING is rounded off, so even if the item isn't divided the only way to find correct pricing is to enter ""33.33"" instead if just ""33"" or ""34"" and rolling the 1/3 into your COGS. Everything is like this and it takes FOREVER to look up pricing for customers. Pricing: We sell bricks of foam and instead of having part numbers available for all the sizing, we have to *hand calculate* every individual sheet by the price/board foot, enter the description of each item in the comment notes, rather than just auto populating with a pert number. I ended up building a custom spreadsheet so I no longer have to hand convert everything. Saves me hours. Still have to enter the product description by hand. Oh, and there are 24 varieties. Credit checks: We have multiple forms of billing and are required to manually look up each individual order that's printed to see if there's any outstanding balances. I've begged for this to be automated (it could be) but the answer is just a straight up ""no"". The annoying part is that the business playea favorites. One customer might owe us $8k for 5 months but if one Visa customer gets missed or has an issue thr office manager gets extremely grumpy. It's mainly busywork. Returns: There's literally 4 sheets of paper being printed and filled out with the same information on it. It's a small offic and ONE person looks at it. You could extrapolate the information. There's a form for the pick-up. We print the relevant invoice (fine, makes sense). THEN there's a separate return form with the info from the invoice and the pickup forms. Then a transfer paper order booklet with the same part number (to ""receive"" it) which is then COPIED so the thin paper doesn't get torn up. JUST MAKE ONE WEB DOCUMENT. WHY WOULD YOU DO IT THIS WAY. Printing Orders: Orders are printed in the office and brought to the warehouse as opposed to just having a printer available so the shippers can grab them as they come in. Orders are frequently added to and reprinted, sometimes hours later without communication so if someone doesn't physically run to the warehouse and shred the previous order, it WILL be double shipped. If it's already been invoiced, that involves running through 3 piles of paperwork to try and dig out the offending order. Invoicing: I don't know of any software that effectively integrates tracking information, so that's yet another manual process. Freight is added after the fact by administration not by the shipping dept- another math problem and manual entry (I also created my own formula for this to save time) and then yhe invoice number that's ALREADY in the damned computer is HAND WRITTEN on the order sheet. Matching happens after EOD but it's supposedly impossible to print invoices in order so the entirety of processed invoices AND the corresponding order forms are sorted by hand and then scanned back into the computer - which already has the invoices saved. Web ordering: The website is absolute trash. Part numbers are listed next to each other and separated by commas. They are not hyperlinked or in a drop-down. Under said numbers are selectable options. Under the options are price breakdowns and a space to enter quantity that don't automatically add up. You have to enter your cart in a separate window to see your items and cost. There is no option to enter a deaired time for in-person pickup orders so customers are required to call. The item photos are not next to the part numbers so there's no way to know if what's being entered is accurate. A lot of customers get very confused and make mistakes placing orders. I know it's just a supply wholesaler and it doesn't need to be fancy but I don't know that I've seen a site organized like this since the year 2001. It's embarrassing to lament to customers that it's not their issue and the web page is basically useless. Maybe I'm nuts for being so offended by all this, but this is the tip of the iceberg. I won't even get into office dynamics. I know most companies function in ""if it's not broken don't fix it"" to avoid the cost of improving. It's not even a difficult job but it is mentally exhausting to do things in the least efficient way possible all the time, every day. I would gladly learn to retrofit the system if they'd pay me for it. Or the ""office manager"" who is responsible for the system could actually perform her job function. Some day I will find a job that exists in the current reality.",0.074,0.841,0.085,0.9187,pos

(Electrical Power Engineering) Hey there, I'm currently studying Power Engineering at University of Belgrade (top 500 ranked uni) and i made that choice cause at the time of me going into college there weren't many options. Belgrade was close enough and offered exactly the kind of program i was looking for and is also very prestigious in Balkans. Technically it's electrical engineering and computer sciense with a specialization in power engineering But now after looking through job market in Western Europe for a bit i see that it's really unknown. Sure, maybe in some academic circles it might recognized but 99% employers never heard of it. Especially since i am looking for more financial or entry managerial jobs. To be exact project managment and physical commodity trading are my intrests (or maybe business development - really any job where i could work with tech but utilize more business - soft skills cause i much rather love sales and working with people and stuff than classical engineering design or maintance jobs). I found a Masters in Energy Managment at ESCP that perfectly covers these two topics and i'll be definitely going there after i finish my Bsc (if i i get in - but i am sure i will cause ESCP is a business school and let's be real - money does all the talking there). Also it gives me basics in more general energy knowladge as it also covers oil & gas and other stuff (gives a good finance base as well). I want to work in energy industry in general so i'll be taking a course from Florence School of Regulation about Energy Market and Regulations. So let me explain my dilemma - after i finish my Bsc and Msc will i be competent for western job market? Will my Bsc be discredited and i wont be able to find jobs? Will prestige of ESCP open doors and people wont care that i finished my bsc at a relativly unknown uni (even though i'll have a excellent foundation). I mean if you ask me, my program is really focused on core power engineeeing - very little electronics, renewables, ai (or any other new buzzwords these western unis use) etc. It is deeply rooted in high level math and theory - focusing on core engineering. I'll post the summary of curriculum below the text so take a look (you can give your own assessment down in the comments). 📘 ETF Belgrade – Power Engineering --- 1st Year 1st Semester Mathematics 1 Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering 1 Physics 1 Programming 1 Physics Laboratory Exercises English 1 Introduction to Computing 2nd Semester Mathematics 2 Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering 2 Programming 2 Electrical Engineering Laboratory English 2 Introduction to Power Engineering Basics of Computer Engineering --- 2nd Year 3rd Semester Mathematics 3 Electromagnetics Circuit Theory Mechanics Fundamentals of Electronics 4th Semester Numerical Mathematics Electrical Measurements 1 Electrical Machines Low Voltage Power Installations Fundamentals of Telecommunications Probability and Statistics --- 3rd Year 5th Semester General Engineering Rotating AC Machines Power Transformers Elements of Power Systems Automatic Control Systems 6th Semester Electricity Market and Deregulation Power System Analysis 1 High Voltage Engineering 1 Power Converters 1 Socio-Economic Aspects of Energy Transition --- 4th Year 7th Semester Distribution and Industrial Networks Switchgear Electric Drives General Power Engineering Electric Vehicles 8th Semester High Voltage Equipment Relay Protection Power Plants Professional Internship Final Thesis --- To be honest, i havent even seen any western uni offer similiar program to mine - they are mostly generic electrical engineering or focus on renewables if they are specilized. Why don't European unis offer such programs? Is this stuff outdated? If they are offering it then which ones? And i want to know from people in the industry what are considered best schools for power engineers - i meant which one have prestige so to say? Or open doors? I mean i really couldnt find any good brand name uni with anything similiar to offer. I even questioned myself who then works at utilities and fills other grunt engineering power jobs if there are no programs for it? I am just trying to see if i made a wrong choice and totally studied something useless in the other parts of europe. I know at the end of the day what school you went to doesnt matter and experience does, where you worked etc. While i studying i did work - done HV equipment sales. It was interesting.

That’s really hard to read, it hurts. Most are simply trying to keep their lives afloat. Rent is due, families need support, and people apply where they genuinely believe they can do the work. I appreciate the perspective, and I’m genuinely glad when someone hasn’t had to go through what many of us have, I hope they never do. But unemployed people aren’t the problem. The issue is a system that’s creaking. If someone is doing everything they can to support themselves or their family in a tough economy, you can’t label them ""the problem."" And, realistically, people don’t apply to roles they think they can’t handle. So what is going on? With full respect to the experts, it’s a mix of factors, where you live, the growing tendency to hire cheaper talent offshore, and a global market that has shifted fast. Remote work widened the competition, automation and AI reduced demand for some roles, and many companies are cutting costs by replacing experienced staff with lower-paid or contract workers. Economic uncertainty also makes employers more risk-averse, they prefer candidates who already match every single requirement rather than those who could grow into the role. On top of that, the big layoff waves haven’t helped: * Google: \~12,000 layoffs announced Jan 20, 2023. * Amazon: 18,000 roles cut announced Jan 5, 2023. * Microsoft: \~9,000 roles (about 4% of the workforce) announced Jul 2, 2025. And there were many more. Companies often cite reasons like economic slowdown, over-hiring during the pandemic, a shift to AI/automation, and general inefficiencies. These numbers matter. The flood of experienced talent from companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others has packed the market with tens of thousands of strong applicants. For each opening, especially in areas like software engineering, data science, or product management, there can be hundreds of candidates, many with top-tier backgrounds. That surplus pushes expectations higher: niche skills, spotless CVs, tailored applications just to get an interview. Even solid candidates can be overlooked or stuck in long searches. The market is brutally selective right now, driven by perception, networks, and algorithmic screening as much as merit. These days, being qualified isn’t always enough; you also have to be visible, positioned well, and consistently adaptive. A quick UK example: plenty of companies hire Tech Leads, Engineering Managers, and Lead Engineers locally, while outsourcing many other roles to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, or South Asia to reduce costs. So before judging anyone for trying too hard, take a moment to think about what they might be carrying, the fear, the pressure, the sleepless nights. Behind every “desperate job seeker” is someone fighting quietly to keep hope alive. Be kind. This market is already cruel enough. A bit of empathy can go a long way.",0.093,0.789,0.118,0.9434,pos

I am not writing this post with the sentiment - 'That grapes are sour' as even before I moved into final stage interviews with them I already had a great offer from one of the respected silicon valley companies with pay package much greater than these guys could have offered and which has EPS of 90%>. BUT I write this post with the genuine intention of raising the red flag to the prospective applicants who want to apply at canonical. These guys don't have any respect and value the time and effort put by the candidates while going through their process and mind you they have audacity to be very pompous about their process and themselves. I went through their complete cycle of recruitment (took almost 2.5 months) after they selected my profile and was brought into their system starting with - 1, A written interview of 41 questions to which I sincerely devoted my time aligning all the questions with examples from my past experience wherever possible and it would have easily taken me about 2 weeks to compile all my answers. 2, Then gave a general intelligence test where I scored - Reasoning- Greater than majority, Perceptual Speed - Faster than majority, Number speed and accuracy - Faster than majority, Word meaning- Higher than majority, Spatial visualization - Higher than majority 3, After this I was called for 3 early stage interviews. a.) First was with someone from my field. He was in company for like 10 yrs and we had a very good catchup which ran upto 1hr30min even though interview was scheduled for 1 hr. He told me on call itself that he will recommend me to go ahead. b.) Second was totally out of place and was with someone who had nothing to do with my profile. He was in company for 15yrs> Questions were behavioral type and I am not sure how much he would have grasped as I had to use examples from my field of work to answer them. c.) Third was with someone from my field but much junior to me. He was asking me very basic stuff and we navigated through the interview with him telling me he will recommend me for a higher profile with regards to my experience. 4. After these interviews after few days I got an invite to give a online personality test and then an interview with someone from a team which they called as Talent Science team :D Any case I gave personality test and then had interview with talent specialist. He told me on the call to make me feel special that I am one of the very few ones who had reached this far :D which seemed more to me of flaunting their selection process. He didn't had any answer to my questions concerning what profile I should expect if I get this role, what salary I can expect, joining etc. but instead he was taking my feedback on these questions and told he will convey them to Hiring lead. \*\*By this time I had already received the offer which I had mentioned earlier but still just wanted to check what they are up-to so went ahead with their process\*\* 5. Week after I got another invite to what they called as Final stage interviews. a.) First one was with someone from related from my field. Again like 15 years in company and we had a good catchup. She went into details concerning the responses I gave and it went good. She told me I might be bit less hands-on, on few things but didn't considered the fact that I was covering 2.5 times the scale of business in my previous role just from one business unit in my region which canonical actually does worldwide, so off-course I had some people to support me on day to day ad-hoc stuff. b.) Second was with Hiring lead. It was very evident from his behavior that he holds lot of authority in selection process and hence was putting himself up on the pedestal. He was telling me during the interview itself that I should reframe my answer like this. He did this 2/3 times. No value add just rephrasing the answer. When I asked to provide details about the role then he described it in very basic terms and when I asked for more details there was no clear answer. He was telling me that in canonical this role is very important unlike other companies to which I had to clarify him the ownership of different tasks which I had in my previous company and the importance of my role in my previous company as well. Any case I didn't want to be disrespectful during the interview and told him thanks for rephrasing the answers and I will keep in mind for future interviews. In the end he told me I should expect another interview with coo after my last final interview. c.) Third was with someone who would have been in my team. He was termed as Hiring manager but during the interview he told me he is not sure if he will be my hiring manager :D We had really good discussions on how things are and the changes going on in the company wrt to my field, where I will fit in the company and things which I can fix with my experience. He was very critical of company's culture in my aspects but he had accepted them by now. He also told me that with my profile I could not expect an interview with Marc as well along with coo and gave tips on how to navigate those interviews. After this personally and after having more than 8 hours of interviewing, written interview, test results and with the positive feedback which I received from the interviews I was surely expecting an executive interview. But here comes their BEST part- I received a cold automated rejection email after few days. No feedback in it, just that it was mentioned that they wont move ahead with my application. I was really really annoyed with the disrespect shown towards me after I had invested so much time with them. So I wrote an email to the Hiring lead, reprimanded him and told this is unacceptable and very disrespectful way to treat an applicant who had invested so much time in their process to which he replied and agreed to do a call. He gave me three reasons and here are they verbatim - 1. That majority of my experience has been from one company +10 years. This was so ironic really as two people who had interviewed me had more than 15 yrs experience and another 10 years in canonical. Hiring lead himself was coming from a service based company after 15 years their. I did tell him if it was great company where I was working and that my career trajectory was going great then why it would cross my mind to change it. No words !! 2. He told me that their were few typos in my essay !! Nothing on the content but on typos and also it came from person who was not from my field :D Again No words !! 3. And final reason he told that I didn't present my answers well. Like giving too much information and not concising them well. That's it. With these justifications I really felt so so stupid of myself to have invested so much time with them and taken this company seriously. By the way again this hiring lead was acting so proud in this call and telling me it was just a matter of whisker I didn't went through. He told my profile is good, my experience is very unique and I should expect an offer soon and I can seek for his help if I need to. I didn't even bother to tell him that I already had a great offer weeks before and let him gloat over. Summary - I know job market is tough, there are so many layoffs happening everywhere in tech industry but still it's really not worth going through the recruitment process of this company. It reflects a lot about their culture as well. If all of their senior executives don't trust their team members to make a call even after interviewing a candidate for 8/9 hours then you can imagine how much autonomy a candidate will have in his day to day work life. I have gone through other rigorous interview processes of big tech companies like for example loop from AWS (which I felt was very pertinent for the role I was applying for and all the questions raised were going into the depths of my experience) but that nothing is as ludicrous as interview process of this company. So if you see a linkedin notification of their job opening then stay far from it. But if you still want to go ahead - Then don't take them too seriously and keep focusing on other interviews which you are having by side and be mentally ready of disrespectful behavior.",0.041,0.826,0.133,0.9994,pos

I'm still in shock that I was able to land anything. Before the offer, I was about 2 months off needing to move back in with my parents. I was laid off in May (with just one month in severance), but was lucky to be able to keep working until September since the project I was on hadn’t wrapped. I had started applying for new roles casually back in September because I could feel the tides shifting at my company, began applying more regularly in January, and really stepped up my search in May. It was hard finding time to apply while still working full-time, and my husband was also laid off during this period, which made it even more stressful. I’ve been in my industry for 12 years and didn’t get any referrals for the jobs I applied to. I never reached out to hiring managers on LinkedIn, and I didn’t send thank-you emails after interviews. In total, I submitted 109 applications. From those, I was called to interview with 14 companies (about a 12.8% rate). I did 29 individual interviews across those 14 companies, including four assessments. Every single process had multiple rounds, and I made it to the final round four times before finally getting my offer. Some rejections were especially tough. One company said they decided they couldn’t afford someone at my level, and another went with an internal candidate. A few ghosted after the first round despite interviews going exceptionally well and being told verbally that I'd be moving on. When I asked for feedback from the final round rejections, almost everyone said they had nothing negative to share, which was honestly the hardest part because it left me with nothing to learn from. I tracked every single application, interview, and response in a spreadsheet, which helped me feel like I was actually doing something and staying in control during a really uncertain time. Every job got a unique resume and cover letter, so I now have 109 versions of both sitting in my files. **Here's what worked for me:** * **Staying loyal pays off:** I had been at my last company for many years, and almost every interviewer commented positively on that stability and loyalty. I'm almost certain this is what got me in the door for most positions (my heart goes out to new grads because of this). * **Being targeted, not broad:** I’m in marketing, but I don’t have experience in large corporate environments. Instead of applying everywhere, I focused on my niche: smaller teams, mission-driven organizations, and creative roles where my background really fit. * **Personalizing every cover letter:** I used ChatGPT to optimize structure and language, but I always rewrote or tailored each cover letter to show genuine enthusiasm for the specific organization. Several hiring managers mentioned how much they appreciated that. * **Preparing deeply for interviews:** Even though I’m outgoing and comfortable in conversation, I prepped for hours (mostly using Chat GPT) before each round by researching the organization, the people, and the challenges the role might address. That helped me handle every question confidently. I know a 12.8% interview rate is actually strong in this market, and I feel really lucky to have landed something relatively quickly, especially compared to others who have been looking longer. But this job market is brutal. I’ll never again be someone who stops networking, updating my resume, or keeping my interview skills sharp. This new role is a salary bump, with better benefits, and in an industry I love. I’m so grateful to be able to say that after the rollercoaster of the last few months.

You'd think experience in the same industry is transferable, no. You need to already know all the tools they use, have been doing the same things for the past 3 years and will sit down and start completing all work required and some more with no introduction or training. And if I were that person why would I even apply to the same grade and get paid similarly? They don't want to train new hires. 2.Apply to entry level role, overqualified, apply to senior level role, under-qualified. I am not applying to the exact roles I'm at right now so I am at a natural disadvantage. Yes, there are those that the requirements are too specific that I don't qualify 100% and might be ""unfit"", but there are also roles that I really would be a strong candidate and I still hear nothing. I suspect masters + seniority in my current title might make them think I am somehow a ""flight risk"". Hey, I explained my motives in my cover letter, if they would just READ IT. 3.Multiple roles in the same job. I've been seeing so many jobs with ""&"" in the title, and when I look into the job descriptions it literally are 3 different roles in a trench coat. The same person will do reporting, client engagement and then ops? And of course they won't pay you as 3 persons, they still pay you as one but think you have 3 heads to wear multiple hats; since you still only have 1 spine (better if you have 0) you count as 1 employee. Cheap bastards. 4.Majority of the time I have to spend more time filling in application than actually tailoring for it. I already have templates set for different roles (both resume and cover letter), and I don't spend too much time tailoring anymore. But these sites, they scare me. You already have my document, but I still need to manually enter my experience, my education, my ""skill"", and the UI is so horrendous that I cannot paste the text into a box, it has to be these shitty ""enter this keyword to see if this word exists in our list then click on it"" box. I've had to sign up for dozens and dozens of applicant accounts and the ones that don't ask me to reenter my resume is maybe like less than 5. Also fk you hirevue 5.It's fundamentally work with no clear reward and progress. They are getting a lot of applicants, fine. And what does that look like from our perspective? Spent time researching the company and understanding the role, carefully prepared the material for applications, crafting a convincing narrative about the career pivot, making sure the document is ATS ready, outreach on LinkedIn for networking, and then nothing, just nothing. It's a black hole that sucks out whatever energy I have left after work, and there is no reward, no progress, no light at the end of this tunnel. It slowly dismantle my mind as I question my life choices, resent I am not a nepo baby, and be bitter at these companies. I'd see news on LinkedIn about X company launching a new program, of which the team I applied to months ago, or another company lunching a new fund that I literally onboarded at my company (and applied on the other side there for 3 different roles, all rejected). Nope, I fit 75 to 85% of their role descriptions, but nope, not 100%, my father and my grandfather did not work in the same roles, I don't carry the correct genes to learn the job functions. 6. AI is making this worse. First, there is this gold rush of ""let's cut position and replace them with AI"". At my company there is this initiative to implement AI in each department and have them report success (yes it's a loaded ""initiative""). It's almost comical because given the setting the data we can actually let the AI access is very limited, and in actual practice we'd spend more time doing QC on the AI work than actually doing it ourselves. We haven't cut any people here yet but I know there are already companies doing this, without understanding the full consequence of it. What even is LLM hallucination anyway? Second, in the same fashion of promoting ""efficiency"" and be ""leading"" the next big thing which is automation, HR is using AI to screen us. And of course they will get flooded by AI touched resume and all sorts of new and shiny lies which they cannot easily vet. The smart AI will decide if your AI interview had too much head movements or that your resume isn't boasting experience with a non-existing tech, to the bin you go. 7.The final chef kiss is just how picky these companies are. At my workplace they've been trying to hire for a junior for FIVE MONTHS. And each time the manager gets an interview she'd tell me they are no good. Like they'd say they have experience with XYZ platforms or programs, and turns out they have never heard of xlookup (wtf?). The manager doesn't look at the raw inbound resumes, she only gets what HR forwards her, and HR does the first round of interview. I have no idea how they are so consistent in ONLY letting in the unqualified candidates, and god knows how many qualifying ones were filtered out. Oh, and remember I said I started applying almost 6 months ago? I am still seeing the same jobs reposted on job boards all the time. Like what in the incompetency is this? They refuse to train, refuse to pay proper wage, refuse to hire enough headcount for each role (just blend 3 roles into one!), and sitting there waiting for the ""right guy"" like some delusional diva. Hmm, but these people surely don't want to work, amrite? I have depression from work and the job search is not making this better. If you've made it this far, thank you",0.086,0.815,0.1,0.9587,pos

Hey guys, I’ve been looking for a new job since the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, even though I’ve tried my best, I haven’t managed to get one yet. Since February, I’ve had interviews with about 15 companies. For around half of them, I reached the final round. I’m mainly looking for technical jobs, and I have a building-related technical degree. I’m also an expat living in Western Europe. The problem is that, while some companies were very fair and even gave me detailed feedback on why I wasn’t selected, others simply ghosted me — even though the interviews went really well, and we were already in the final stages of the process. I know some people might think this is due to bureaucracy, but that’s not the case — I’m an EU citizen. The truth is, I have struggled for many years with generalized anxiety, PTSD, and panic disorder, and I’ve been in long-term therapy and on medication. This whole situation has been extremely hard on my mental health. I usually try to remind myself that it’s about them, not about me — that I did my best and wasn’t treated with basic respect — but it’s still very difficult to cope. My question is: what would *you* do in this kind of situation? Most of my local friends tell me to be more insistent — to send follow-up emails, then make phone calls, and keep reaching out until I get a response. But from my experience (and from therapy), I don’t think that’s a healthy approach. Why? Because I truly believe you can’t “educate” people who lack basic respect. Not even sending a short rejection email is a sign of poor character from them, and I don’t think you can change that and the way they are. To me, things like that are the *bare minimum* — an automated response or a simple update is a bare minimum I mean— and feels unhealthy if i insist to get that bare minimum. So I prefer not to chase them. I assume that if a company doesn’t respond within a reasonable time, they probably won’t at all. Let me give you a few examples(but they are several other examples): * June. I waited three weeks, then sent a polite follow-up email. Still no response — not even today. So clearly, calling them (as my friends advised) wouldn’t have helped. I don’t want to beg people to do their job — and sending a rejection email *is* part of their job. * August. I made it to one of the final interviews. They promised to send me a technical test and said they’d decide after that. I never received the test, and I didn’t insist. * September. This one was especially painful. The company seemed great and promising. They told me I’d get an answer within two weeks, after we had talked about salary and working schedule. After four weeks of silence, I reached out, and they immediately replied:“Sorry, we decided not to move forward with you, we already decided this 2 weeks ago. I didn’t know my colleague hadn’t contacted you — maybe he forgot.” That moment triggered one of my worst mental breakdowns of the year. I had assumed ,before their answer, that they were still deciding, which is why I hadn’t heard back. What hurt wasn’t the rejection itself, but the fact that I had to *humiliate myself in a way* by sending a polite email just to get the basic respect of an answer that they already promised during the final round of interviews. And now, it’s happening again. I had another final-round interview and they’re already 10 days late with their promised response. I don’t want to email them and “force” them to do what they should have already done. My friends still tell me to insist, but honestly, I already know the answer of this last company. And i do not want to be again disappointed that they said: ""we forgot, we choose a while ago somebody else but we kept you there,etc"" So here’s my core question: **How do you cope with this kind of situation?** And why do companies — even those with good reviews — behave like this toward promising candidates who reach the final round? It happens to me almost every time I get that far, and I genuinely don’t understand why. Of course, I don’t want to “fix” those people, but as an analytical person, I want to understand *how* and *why* these things happen. Also, I am honestly scared because a vast majority of the companies I have been to for an interview this year have this kind of approach(not with ghosting, but also with a lack of respect and not being eager to do the bare minimum).",0.091,0.782,0.127,0.978,pos

It's an active fork of the original Jobs\_Applier\_AI\_Agent\_AIHawk (which now is inactive) project, but with a ton of new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Here's the link: And here’s why this bot is different: \- It can apply to ALL jobs, not just ""Easy Apply."" Thanks to the browser-use library, the bot can navigate and fill out applications on third-party sites. \- If you don't trust application process to LLM, you can just use it in collection mode, in which bot doesn't apply jobs, only gathers information for interesting jobs and saves them to the file. Then you can explore this file and apply these jobs yourself. \- The bot analyzes job descriptions and compiles statistics on the most in-demand skills, helping you understand what to focus on. \- Protection of personal data. The bot anonymizes your personal data before sending it to the LLM, so your sensitive information stays secure. \- AI-powered resume tailoring. It doesn't just use one resume for all applications. The AI analyzes the job description and tailors your resume for each specific vacancy, adapting your skills, experience, and projects to create the best possible match. \- I've swapped Selenium for Playwright, which means faster, more stable, more secure browser automation and also supports headless mode out of box. \- And yes, it has a headless mode, so you can keep working on your computer without a browser window popping up. \- You can pause and resume the bot at any time with a simple Ctrl+X command. \- It also tries to fix apply form errors: if a LinkedIn ""Easy Apply"" form has issues, the bot will try to fix them on its own. \- Advanced question answering. It uses an LLM to automatically parse your resume and intelligently answer all types of application questions and even adds previously asked questions to context if necessary. \- Sending errors and reports via Telegram. You get detailed reports and error notifications sent directly to your Telegram chat. And many additional improvements and features that you can read about in README file. It also supports multiple LLM providers like Gemini (recommended), OpenAI, Claude, and even local models with Ollama. Plus, it's packed with features to make it more robust and easier to use, like Pydantic configuration, secure secret management, and automated scheduling. Of course, a word of caution for the ""Non-Easy Apply"" feature: it's powerful but LLM often can't successfully apply to that types of job + it can consume a lot of tokens, so use it wisely.

I say this with all the love and exhaustion in my heart: if you already have a job (one you can stomach) please stop applying to everything just to “see what’s out there.” What’s wild is that most people applying for jobs right now already have one. I sorted through some job-search data from 2023 and more than half of employed (Americans, specifically) are still looking for new roles. Which means that unemployed people are competing with people who already have paychecks, benefits, and stability. No wonder it feels impossible out here. Some of us have been unemployed for months, watching automated rejections pile up within minutes. It’s not just demoralizing- it’s survival. And when people who already have paychecks are shotgunning apps out of curiosity or mild boredom, it clogs the system for those of us genuinely trying to get back on our feet. I get it. I used to be that person. I’d apply while comfortably employed because I was curious about the market. So maybe this is my karma lol. But being on this side of it now? It hits different. There’s a real human cost to the “I just want a change” wave that’s flooding every posting these days. So if you have stability right now, hold onto it. Rest. Breathe. Wait until you need to move. Because for a lot of us, this isn’t about wanting something new, it’s about wanting something period. 🫶🏼 *POST REPLY EDIT* Just to clarify- I’m not talking about people who are struggling with their mental health, feeling underpaid, or stuck in toxic jobs. If that’s your reality, then you don’t have a good or sustainable job. My post isn’t directed at you. I’m talking about the people who already have stable, tolerable jobs (the kind you can stomach) and are still mass-applying just to “see what’s out there.” That’s where the lack of consideration comes in. There’s a difference between fighting to survive and casually browsing for something shinier. It’s about humanity. The market is already brutal for those of us who have been unemployed for months, doing everything right, and still getting ghosted. So yeah, it stings seeing people with steady paychecks flooding the same listings just because they’re curious. I wasn’t saying people shouldn’t have goals or try to better their lives. I was saying if you already have a good, stable job right now, maybe recognize that others don’t. The market’s brutal. If I were still securely employed in this climate, I’d probably just stay put for a while out of empathy and self-awareness for those living the opposite. It’s not about blame — it’s about perspective and I simply come from one of communal, ecosystem impact. That’s all. Everyone’s out here surviving different realities. Turning off these notifications.

The email started with, *Hi, Viola. Here’s what AI recommends for this student…* What followed was some pretty generic starter advice— things I already know and teach to my students. What I had been hoping for was slightly more focused advice for this student’s problem. I was disappointed, but said thanks and moved on and just asked the question of a fellow teacher. I got a much better answer from the teacher, who asked pointed questions and essentially told me “Once you’ve done this and figured out what the problem is with this student, come talk to me and I can share with you what’s worked for me in the past.” I was disappointed at first, as I said. But now I’m just… insulted, I guess is the word.

Hi, I'm the younger sister of an ELA teacher and I am constantly hearing her talk about how hard it is to be a teacher, and how none of her students care anymore in lessons. I just wanted to help her so came on here for advice, all is appreciated! She teaches middle school ELA but apparently getting everyone to focus and genuinely care about their work is near-impossible. Many of her students do nothing all lesson except draw in their notebooks or play games on their devices or watch tiktok etc.. But then when the consequences roll around like failing modules and having a tanked GPA, she gets parents on the phone practically swinging at her about how bad of a teacher she is. It seems like such a losing game though because she's tried multiple methods of teaching but it seems the common denominator is that the kids simply do not care. They'll happily sit there all lesson doing nothing but then when they get held back at lunch or break to actually do their work, they throw child-like fits. This has happened in other classes too, where my sister told me that her colleagues have also noticed the general lack of care and enthusiasm in today's students - alot of them blame AI and technology. Of course we're a bit into this academic year, and my sister was telling me that out of the 26 kids in her 7th grade class, only 3 of them genuinely cared to learn and willingly did the extra reading, revision etc. So, they started out strong. However, the less motivated kids in the class started picking on these 3 and they ended up crumbling against the peer pressure, so now they also don't focus in class anymore. My sister did pull the 3 of them aside after class a few weeks ago, and they all said the same thing - it's impossible to concentrate when everyone around you is making noise or not focusing or making comments at you for actually working. Honestly it breaks my heart how these kids are getting demotivated by those around them. After a bit of reassurance to those kids, my sister decided to be more authoritative - strict bans on devices in the classroom despite school policy allowing them, and telling them the harsh truth that if you still cant spell ""pomegranate"", then yes you will be held back a grade. But, they just did not care. A couple kids walked out of the class swearing and the rest just sat there for the hour, though in silence, and still did nothing. Alot of kids use chatgpt or jennie for their assignments too, but when they are given closed book quizzes they can't answer basic questions. like basic basic. like ""what is alliteration"" basic. It's so concerning given that these kids are supposed to be leading their generation, but all they seem to be able to do is talk to chatgpt and disrespect the real teachers with real experience right infront of them. My sister wants to arrange a parent-teacher conference with some other teachers in other subjects present, mainly to address the attitudes of their kids, but I'm worried they'll get ganged up on by parents who evidently coddle their kids too much to bother acknowledging fundamental issues in their learning. The school my sister teaches at is a top school in her state, but with the way these students are headed, i doubt it'll stay that way. She showed me some assignments she was marking on facetime, and these 8th graders still couldnt tell ""you're"" from ""your"", ""stationary"" from ""stationery"" - all very basic mistakes that she had been over time and time again. Also reading aloud is hell, since many of the kids don't actually understand phonics, so reading a page will take maybe 15 minutes and 20 corrections from my sister. She tries so hard to make these kids motivated to learn, but I can see why so many teachers are quitting now. If anyone has advice, please let me know and I'll pass it onto my sister.

A student asked me today whether or not I use AI when generating questions. As per our admin. our school is taking a unique approach to AI in general for teachers. We’ve begun to receive education and professional development training in AI for faculty and are being encouraged to use curriculum specific generative AI platforms that are already at our disposal (ones associated/embedded within our writing curriculum and morphology curriculum). In these areas, I’m doing all the explicit instruction and modeling. But the programs provide me with student facing work and anticipated responses. Their opinion is that the students are using it for better or worse (whether detrimental to their academic careers or not…), so teachers should be engaging with it as well to help bridge the gap between using it ethically and identifying the pitfalls of it in terms of academics. We’ve even gone as far to revise a school-wide AI policy then create department specific policies to attach to syllabi. So naturally when the student asked, I needed to take a beat and think about my response. I disclosed that yes in fact I use it in some instances to generate response forms but also acknowledged that I review what it gives me for accuracy. I stressed that we did the work to build the base of knowledge with the text and the lifting of doing the learning through the activities and the fact that I do most of the lift for researching appropriate articles and planing of the course. I felt uncomfortable having to explain myself at first but then I had a thought. How much does AI differ from published curriculums, teacher blogs, and teacher pay teachers?

I'm still on the crossroads between whether I wan't to teach high school and middle school. My college's secondary education program has us spend a lot of time in both of these, but so far, I've only experienced some time in middle school (just observing and some helping out) and so far, its been a lot of fun, yet also a bit stressful. For those who have the experience, what are the main differences between these? What are the highs and lows of both middle school and high school? Is it easy to switch from one to the other if I dislike my first decision? 2. With the rise of AI in recent years, I've seen firsthand just how easy and tempting it is to use AI to help out with, or fully complete assignments for people. I personally don't like AI because of this and hopefully plan to keep it out of my future classroom entirely. It's already depressing and de-motivating just thinking about pouring effort into a classroom that responds with the words of a polite robot. Has there been any effective methods that keep AI from influencing student work (especially in terms of history-based work such as research and papers)? I've already considered the possibility of having all my students do their work handwritten, in class, with no technology available (other than maybe for research). 3. Other than observing/helping out classrooms and continuing my college education is there anything that I could do to better prepare myself becoming a real teacher? I've been considering looking for a non-teaching job in a local school, but am not entirely sure if that is even a possibility. Would most teachers in middle/high school be willing to have a college student TA or likewise job? 4. I’m also considering becoming a firefighter and plan to earn the necessary qualifications, such as EMT certification, after graduation. From a teaching perspective, I’m wondering whether it’s realistic to balance a firefighting career during the summer while teaching throughout the rest of the year, or if that time would need to be devoted to preparing for upcoming semesters. If that kind of balance isn’t really possible, would it be a better idea to focus on firefighting for several years and transition into teaching after retirement? My main concern is maintaining the quality of my teaching, meaning that I want to ensure that if I do pursue both careers, or shift between them, I’ll still be an effective and engaged educator.",0.044,0.843,0.113,0.9874,pos

However, I have the following language in my syllabus (rephrased to protect privacy): AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are not policed. But note, they are prone to generating incorrect, biased, or fabricated information. You are fully responsible for all content you submit — including errors, misinformation, offensive or unethical material — whether it originates from you or an AI tool. If you use AI, you must clearly acknowledge it in your submission. Failure to disclose AI use is considered cheating and a violation of the University’s Academic Integrity Code. **Any violation will result in an automatic grade of 0.** Students are required to complete a syllabus quiz where they are basically asked to restate the course's AI policy. I also have a lecture where I specifically outline tips to help students be successful in the course. The AI policy is also reiterated in that lecture. I gave the students a fairly easy, 50 point assignment. They simply had to write a 2-3 page paper about one of three health topics provided.

So, I am not sure how I feel about this. I always knew it was a ""see if you actually read"" assignment, but this is the first time it caught plagiarism. To keep this from being found out (I'm sure students lurk) I'm changing a few things. Let's say this is an art history course. I have a reading assignment called ""Stone, Wood, Metal, Plastic."" It's basically a slide deck I've created. However, when you open the deck, you realize that it's not literally about stone, wood, metal, or plastic. It's about sculptures made out of those materials. My (altered and not as clear) question is... Do you see alignment in ""Stone, Wood, Metal, Plastic?"" Every year, I get people telling me about the relationship between stone, wood, metal, or plastic - they do not mention the sculptures at all. Great, now I know you don't read (and these are pre-class quizzes. Love the look on their face when I go over the reading... lolol) But this year, THIS FUCKING YEAR, I got the SAME WRONG ANSWER **FIVE, 5** times. *Base version ""I see a lot of alignment in them.* ***Stone comes from rock, wood comes from trees, metal is from the earth and plastic is man made.*** *But despite their different origins, all of the materials can be used to make scupltures.""* That middle sentence was what got them. Others also didn't read, but the 5 each wrote a similar middle sentence - explaining the origin of the different materials (with slight variation) - and then brought them all together at the end. Not one word about the sculptures they were actually supposed to be comparing. Nope, just AI slop that used the definitions of the words. I guess they thought everyone had their own personal AI. The funny thing is... every semester when I grade this assignment, I have a few students who miss it because they didn't read. As an instructor who does care, I always think ""Should I have used the sculpture names - or the word ""sculpture"" in the document title? Should the question have alluded to the content? Should I have linked the reading in the question?"" Then I think FUCK NO. Quite a few students wrote about the sculptures - this is only a problem if you are a shitty student. But this is the first year that I had 5 similar wrong answers - so now it's got a new role with regard to AI - so I am keeping it exactly the way it is (and yes, I will be reviewing previous assignments.) So... Here's an idea to catch AI (who knew???) If you can, have a reading assignment titled with common words (aligned with the content) that have a different meaning within the course/document, then ask a very simple (no context) question about the reading referencing the title. That might work - some of them are literally that lazy. (Oh - and it wasn't supposed to be a ""gotcha"" assignment. It's like 10 different statues - too many to use in the title - and they ARE supposed to consider them with regard to their materials. I didn't expect for no one to even LOOK at it. It's ONE slide that sets the context and the rest of the deck is MOSTLY PICTURES; like seriously???)",0.07,0.862,0.068,-0.4548,neg

They are supposed to compare/contrast the methods in two research articles and talk about their strengths and weaknesses. I think the assessment is valuable to the learning outcomes so I didn't want to drop it. So I thought, why not use class time to have them write the paper? It also helps that I have a 3 hour unbroken block of time for this class. I prepped them three weeks ahead of time. Once I approved their articles, I told them to read them and take notes in advance. They could bring hand-written notes to the ""test day."" It helped to print out the articles so they didn't have to keep flipping between screens. I stood in the back of the class and monitored their screens in the computer lab. I watched for 3 hours as they worked on their papers. If I would do this again, I would: \- Remind them to come prepared to sign-in to the school computer and then sign-in to Google Docs or Word. This took about 15 minutes of signing in and setting up their writing space. \- I would probably have them work exclusively in Google Docs. It's compatible with GPT Zero and I like the feature of replaying their writing. I don't think this works with Word. \- Another disadvantage to Word is that it doesn't save their work automatically to the cloud—they have to manually select this. If they save to computer, those files might disappear if they log-off. I was kind of aghast that some students working in Word didn't save their file anywhere AT ALL until the very end. \- I didn't want to fumble around with lockdown browser or block certain websites, but I might explore that in the future. Other things I noticed: I did go around the room to answer questions and give feedback. This was a paper and I wanted to help them make corrections in real time. I helped many students who had questions about citation formatting. Almost all of them wanted me to show them how to do hanging indents. Their mind was blown for some reason when I showed them the ruler slides. I guess they're not teaching how to manipulate margins in school? I also stopped a few papers that were going to annoy me, for example, one student was going submit their entire paper CENTERED in the middle of the page. I helped students who had questions about terms or details in their article that were confusing. Some chose studies that were highly technical so I didn't mind helping out there. One poor student thought that the ""first published on"" and ""accepted by"" dates meant that the researchers collected data during that time. They asked if that was correct. I was happy to clear that up for them because that would have been a major error (they are learning how to read research articles in this class). A lot of them spent a full hour getting warmed up, just working on their introduction. One student finished within an hour. I asked why. She said she took copious notes ahead of time. I checked her notes and they looked legit (lots of article mark-up). By the end of the period, about 4 students were remaining, but were almost done. So in a class of 22, all students were able to write the paper in a 3 hour timeframe. Students asked permission for a few things. One wanted to listen to brown noise on their phone. I allowed it. Another wanted to use Grammerly. I didn't allow that. A few said they needed to step out take a call from their kids. I allowed this since it's a paper, not a test. I also let them take a walk around the building to refresh if they wanted. One student was really lost, didn't even open the assignment instructions or look at my previous feedback. Just sat down and banged out a paper that will likely earn them a D/F. I asked students if they liked writing a paper like this. Some of them said it was nice to not have any distractions and focus. Others said it wasn't any different from working at home. Others were ""meh."" Glancing through the papers, they are not as polished or as thorough as the ones that are written from home (comparing to previous semesters). But at least I know it's their work?

UPDATE Thanks for the advice, I’ve cooled down a bit and learned some more. Root cause: As many of you suspected, it was an accidental disclosure of the solution. While setting up at the podium, my TA unintentionally projected my solution against the whiteboards for less than 30 seconds (screen wasn’t down yet). When she noticed, she asked whether anyone had taken a photo. More than 25 students were present, no one admitted to a photo. I have found one person who received a photo and copied it for his submission. Believe me, he tried his best to lie his way out of it but the truth hits hard. I meet with the two who used openpyxl on Friday and I’m trying to unravel the rest. One student caught outright said half the people at the TA session got a picture. When one asked, “Am I going to get expelled for this?” I said no, not that severe, but you are in the “find out” stage of FAFO. His eyes told me he understood that one. I have to assume it was freely available and the whole assignment is compromised. Sadly, the one I’ve found so far who provided the photo to others didn’t use my solution in his submission … he just tanked his friends. More later =====~=====~=====~=====~===== So, colleagues, I need your advice on this one. I have a new incident of cheating on a major multi-week assignment worth 5% of the students’ grades. One student team chose to submit a spreadsheet solution that was my own. I liken this to a scammer pilfering from my warehouse and then trying to sell me my own product for points. I had developed a new solution slide for the assignment in preparation for Friday’s lecture coming up. I don’t know how these boys got their hands on it, either they intercepted an email between me and my student instructor or they were dumpster diving and found a paper copy in my office suite that I had discarded during development. It could also have been a photo of a screen taken somewhere, such as off my student instructor’s screen when she was looking at the solution. I doubt there’s any collusion on my student instructor’s part. Regardless of how they got it, they pumped the image through some library that converted it to Excel .xlsx, values only, of course, no formulas, complete with my idiosyncratic column labels. How do I know? I recognized my own work and the file metadata shows the document owner is OPENPYXL, a somewhat well-known Python library used in scripting. My students name shows for “last modified”, a death blow. So here’s the judgment call… It is within my power to fail the students for either the assignment or the entire course as a result of this incident, along with a referral to the Provost. Given the (edited) nature of this cheating incident, I’m leaning towards an F for the course. It’s not as though they came up short and asked GPT to help them craft a better answer, no, they went straight to the source and stole from me and then tried to fool me with my own product.

If a student submits an AI generated essay, they harm their potential for learning. They violate whatever moral standings they had. They risk failing because the bot produced shoddy work. But what incentive do I have to prevent that? Do I lose money if too many students fail? No. Do I get money for catching cheaters? No. Will promoting academic honesty and citizenship help me obtain promotions in my department? Nope. In fact, my department has made it clear that nobody is getting promoted for years. At this point my only incentive to promote academic honesty is my own conscience and my own values regarding education and the respect I have for my field. Except, failing them won’t make them suddenly try. They’re cheating either because they lack the fundamentals to complete an intro to college writing course themselves or because they don’t value anything except the degree. In either case, failing them won’t wake them up or suddenly fill the years of gaps in their education. So *who* exactly am I helping but myself? What is my end goal in this crusade against ChatGPT except to ingratiate my own self-importance that completing the assignments I designed is some valuable experience? The students don’t think so and the university doesn’t think so. The people paying me don’t care and the people I’m teaching don’t care. So neither will I. Maybe if in a few years there’s some education revolution and the vibes shift towards values that reflect mine I’ll start caring again.

For the umpteenth time, I saw the Amazon commercial featuring a college student who returns home for the holidays to find her bedroom transformed into a gym. Something about the narration got me thinking about my own undergrad experience. I attended a college located three hours away in a neighboring state, and it really did promote a measure of independence that I might not have achieved otherwise. To paraphrase Paul, I put away childish things when I went to college, seeing home and school as two distinct and separate spheres. Nowadays, I teach at a university—the largest by enrollment in the state—that literally does not own a set of dorms. Every semester, I have maybe a handful of students who live on their own. There are so many variables to consider here, which is why I wanted to pose this observation to the group for some discussion. But I assume the rate of students living at home has increased in the United States (understandably!), and I can't help but wonder if this is contributing to some of the problems we see with engagement, infantilization, etc. If the biggest change you make as you matriculate is simply to drive to another group of buildings...well, I can see how that would feel like an extension of K-12. IMO, success in college is contingent upon a willingness to not only learn, but *unlearn*, and it seems like a familiar physical environment could reinforce lackluster study habits, etc., creating additional obstacles for students. Then again, I speak from a place of privilege. We teach a ton of underprivileged/first-gen/nontraditional students; the economy isn't what it used to be; we're beset by uncertainty about the shifting job market and whether AI could replace us all, etc. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts!

This is most relevant for elite R1 bioscience programs as that is where I am, have been for the last decade plus, and where all the other people I know are. - You need to absolutely ask potential advisors about what the support packages look like and how they plan to pay for you. Every single department is cutting admissions, some more than others. In addition to cutting admissions, the support from the university is getting cut too, meaning students will have to be paid off of advisor grants or through TAships rather than fellowships. The support packages of some of the best schools I know have been completely gutted (5 yrs -> 1 yr). There's a TA line crunch at others due to more general budget cuts. A few departments are still offering 5 years guaranteed but even those unicorns may not be around for long. Don't assume that fancy name = great support because that is not true anymore. - Assistant professors have guaranteed money and recruitment priority. This is especially relevant for direct admit programs. At the severely diminished recruitment numbers we're seeing this year, your best bet will therefore be assistant professors, especially brand new ones. There's a particular kind of risk with joining someone ""unproven"": they may end up being neurotic micromanagers, you'll be less independent, they'll have fewer connections. But assistant profs in top departments especially are selected from out of hundreds of applicants and likely to be on a trajectory to stardom. Being the first person in their lab will do incredible things for your career. Most departments will try their best to look out for their young profs so that may end up being the only viable path to academia this cycle and perhaps for the next few... - Apply broadly. The cuts happening are extreme (50% or more even at the highest levels) and that is going to create lots of downward pressure on admissions. - The PhD market will be depressed for several years. The issue is that basically every department had record yields the last cycle, meaning that far more students accepted than predicted. At the same time, funding has been cut. This has overloaded the various pools of money used to pay for students and cohorts will need to graduate before we can be ""back to normal."" - Don't use AI to generate emails to professors. Don't do weird things like tell lies that are easily fact checkable (or just don't lie in your emails). Don't email us from your MIT.edu email you got from a summer internship when you are actually at a much lower ranked school. You playing these games annoys us more than anything. For me and many I know, these emails go straight to the garbage bin and the sender is blocked. You need to articulate concisely why you are interested in working with a prof in that first email.

Updating with the full text as I agree with commenters that the headline is divisive - and because access is by subscription. ""Employment is in chaos. Tariffs are battering global supply chains. The tech companies behind large language models (LLMs) say their products will soon automate away huge swaths of jobs, replacing occupations that have existed for decades (like programming) or millennia (writing, child care) with unprecedented new jobs overseeing automated work — jobs whose skill needs no one can predict. If the generative AI geese do lay these golden eggs for investors, we may face unemployment on a scale to rival the industrial revolution. If they don’t, some already fear a tech-stock crash to rival 1929. Either way, the promises of LLMs are already causing mass firings and turning employment on its head. Last year, graduates with bachelor degrees in art history and philosophy secured jobs at better rates than those with computer-science degrees, the proverbial most and least employable majors trading places. This is a dire moment to enter the work force. It is a perfect moment to spend four to seven years acquiring rare and valuable skills before entering a work force which will not be, in five years, what it is now. As an alumna of Harvard’s Ph.D. program, it is heartbreaking watching my alma mater, which just triumphantly won its standoff with President Trump, cut its Ph.D. admissions by 75 percent when doctorates have never been more needed. Proponents of slashing Ph.D. programs tend to focus on the claim that there are no academic jobs, therefore no use for doctorates. Now, academic hiring is still happening; indeed, my own department just conducted a deep survey of our Ph.D. alums which confirmed that the percentage of them securing academic jobs has remained shockingly constant at about 70 percent all the way back to 1981. But rather than debating the numbers, for the moment let’s explore the doomsday scenario in which the worst fears are realized and there is zero academic-job hiring in 2030. The Ph.D. process teaches broad expertise in research methods. Doctorate holders know how to evaluate evidence, chase down sources, verify claims. They learn methods for finding reliable information, when to be suspicious of data, and how to act upon those suspicions. In addition to learning what we know, a Ph.D. student gains expertise in what we don’t know, learning where the frontiers in a field are, the big questions, incompleteness, and areas a field has not yet tackled. Someone with a Ph.D. can often look at a graph and say, not “that isn’t true,” but “that data doesn’t exist.” This is a dire moment to enter the work force. It is a perfect moment to spend four to seven years acquiring rare and valuable skills before entering a work force which will not be, in five years, what it is now. For the first half of the 2010s, Nokia hired people with graduate degrees in any subject, from art history to linguistics to astrogeology, to verify map coordinates for its navigation program Nokia HERE, because supervisors found that people with a master’s degree or doctorate in any subject had the right combination of rigor, patience, and research experience to do the thorough work the project needed. That kind of work — checking the output of an automated computer-mapping process — is extremely similar to what might shortly become the most in-demand new occupation in a decade. We should not greet an age likely to face an unprecedented need for fact-checking and verification by ceasing to train the very experts who can best meet that demand. One crisis facing us is the mass erosion of confidence in expertise. Daily we see political leaders purge experts from public service, replace skilled specialists with businessmen, and even paint expertise in a field as a disqualifying bias. Anti-science rhetoric has stirred even the most neutral and apolitical scientific bodies to sound the alarm. Ph.D. holders are not just experts but ambassadors for expertise, able to explain and show what real expertise means in a field, and help people see why expertise is valuable. Throughout the last century, Ph.D. holders have worked in government, journalism, law, social service, industry, justice, education, defense, arts, entertainment; we cheer to see a Ph.D. holder running for office, advising Congress, staffing the halls of power, or speaking on TV. Every economic field has found the rare Ph.D. holder who entered it to bring invaluable research skills and perspective. In my own world of science-fiction and fantasy novel-writing, a huge range of Ph.D. holders like myself — Arkady Martine (history), Amitav Ghosh (social anthropology), R.F. Kuang (East Asian languages and literature), Alastair Reynolds (astrophysics), Harry Turtledove (history), Alison Sinclair (epidemiology) — are pouring out award-winning books saturated with our individual expertise, and bringing enthusiasm for our fields to tens of thousands of readers. Amid an active effort to purge expertise from the halls of power, it is baffling to see colleges themselves climb on that bandwagon and accept the claim that, if there are no academic jobs, we should train no Ph.D.s — a claim which accepts the false premise that there is no use for Ph.D.s outside academe. Earth’s oldest universities will soon celebrate their 1,000-year anniversary. Our collective project of advancing and safeguarding the future of human industry has faced seismic historical shifts before, from the print revolution on. We have never, in that history, doubted that producing expertise is valuable for the world, not only in tried-and-true ways but in new ways which would help meet and lead the changes creating new eras. If we fear computer-generated falsehoods may soon drown out both truth and real human expression, how will we develop new means to meet this crisis if we respond to it by shrinking Ph.D. cohorts and producing fewer experts capable of helping us face this revolution? We do not know what jobs will be in demand in five years, or in one year, and undergraduates now choosing majors based on employability face the terrifying likelihood that what is employable today will not be so by the time they graduate. Doctoral study is the inverse of this uncertainty. We absolutely know that expertise, research skills, patience, and understanding how to go about investigating and evaluating truth and falsehood will always be in demand, especially in a society racing to meet new needs in an information revolution. There has never been a better time, from the student’s perspective, to continue studying for a few more years to gain deep skills. Nor has there ever been a better time for institutions to support the production of deeply expert leaders who will be needed in the next stage of this crisis. We did not respond to past revolutions — political or technological — by doubting our core mission to safeguard and advance the future of human inquiry. We should not do so now.""",0.091,0.813,0.096,0.9219,pos

I've heard mixed things about how much this matters for top 20 PhD programs. For some context, my GPA in math dropped a bit in my final semester (from 3.95 to 3.84) because I decided to juggle a lot all at once, including a part-time remote job, a couple of research projects and fairly difficult classes.

Since then, I've learned to manage my health and time better, and understand my limits.

However, my job is more than an hour’s drive from home, and even though I have a relatively short teaching schedule, the commuting is exhausting. I feel like I have no time for anything — I can’t read, prepare my papers, or organize my research. I’m also struggling to prepare my classes properly for my students. Because the teaching hours are short, the salary is low, and I’m basically surviving with help from family. In this context, I’ve been thinking about taking an education loan (what we call a crédito formação in Portugal). My idea would be to borrow enough money to live “comfortably” for this first academic year, pay only the interest during that period, and then go back to work next year. The thought of living with no income, entirely supported by a loan, makes me anxious. Of course, I can’t predict the future, but if things went badly, I could move back in with my mother and work in teaching again — there’s a strong demand for teachers in my area. If things went well, this could be a year of real investment in my future, which I hope will continue in research and academia. I’m also planning to apply for a PhD grant next year, but if I keep working, I’ll hardly have time to strengthen my CV or make progress with publications. On the other hand, if I stop working, I’m afraid I might lose motivation or still fail to achieve the academic results I expect. Has anyone here ever taken this kind of loan or faced a similar decision? Was it worth it? Or is it a completely crazy idea?

I have a position in a research lab and have a short-term research project with a different professor that will lead to publication, I also did a research study abroad program, which are good things. I want to get a biomedical or cell biology PhD one day, I would love to study stem cells or cancer biology or something along those lines, I am extremely passionate about it all and cannot see myself doing anything else with my life at all. My low grades are in part due to chronic illness and pain (which caused bad sleep issues and lots of appointments that totally messed with my time management and success in class), as well as the fact that I got all of my prereqs out of the way in high school and began college with really difficult 300 level STEM classes at a school known for being difficult and having grade deflation. I had a better GPA last year compared to my first year, and am trying really hard this year to improve more, and get above a 3.0 threshold for grad admissions.

I also have no options for letters of req at the moment. I didn't know I would be graduating early until 6 months ago and thought I would have more time to improve grades and get relationships with professors...

The problem is, I really dislike what I’m doing. I work in the defense sector, with outdated tech stacks, long projects, and little innovation. About six months ago, I realized how much I missed academia (the math, the research, the feeling of exploring something new) so I decided to apply for PhD programs. I’m 28, an EU citizen, and I’ve been applying mostly in Europe and Asia (avoiding the US mainly for political reasons and because the programs there are very long). Unfortunately, I haven’t been accepted anywhere yet. I’ve had some interviews and even got on a few shortlists, but I’ve never been selected (most positions I applied to had 200+ applicants and I received the usual email ""this position was very competitive with 200 applicants...""). Here’s my situation in short: * My application is quite ""basic"". * I have two Letters of Recommendation that are okay, but not exceptional (more along the lines of “It was a pleasure working with him; he’s capable,” etc.). * I don’t have any publications. * My MSc thesis had a small research component, but it was mostly practical. * My grades are decent but not top-tier (around 3.7/4.0 GPA equivalent, or 100/110 in Italy, which isn’t considered outstanding here). * I’m not even applying to places way out of reach (no UK or ETH Zurich-level programs). The biggest issue is that I lack research experience. Apart from my thesis, I haven’t done much research, and my current job has nothing to do with my academic interests. I’m mainly targeting PhDs in Machine Learning / AI or Applied Mathematics (PDEs, SPDEs, or related areas). I usually look for programs on sites like AcademicTransfer, FindAPhD, and AcademicJobs, but so far, no luck. I’ve noticed that pure/applied math PhDs are rare on those portals, is it better to directly contact professors for those? At this point, I’m not sure how to move forward besides sending out more applications while I work full-time. How can I realistically improve my profile? * Should I try collaborating with someone and publishing a paper (and if so, how can I even find people open to that)? * Would doing a pre-doc or research assistant position help, and where can I find these roles? I rarely see them on LinkedIn. My main issue is that the things I have done until now are clearly not working (which are usually emailing the PI of a program I find on those websites with my CV, then applying to that position on the university portal) and I don't really know what else I could do. How can I show ""research experience""? Where can I find people open to ""external contributors"" to their research? If I were to continue working, most jobs in those fields (ML, AI, Math) are either on the engineering side, or require a PhD to do research, so I had no luck entering those either.

I know AI Research is a long shot without a PhD/publications, but I want to take my best possible shot. I'm trying to figure out what type of Master's (or PhD) is the most strategic move. # My Profile: * **Job:** Machine Learning Engineer return offer at a **Fortune 50 non-tech company**. * **GRE:** **168Q / 156V / 3.5 AWA** * **Undergrad:** **3.7 GPA** in a STEM major (e.g., Data/Stats/Math) from a T15 public university. * **Other Ed:** **4.0 GPA** from community college (transferred). * **Weaknesses:** I have no publications. I'm not a ""cracked"" math competition person, but I'm driven and highly interested in the theory. # My Dilemma & Questions: Given that I have a great job offer, I'm leaning heavily toward prestigious **part-time or online Master's programs** that I can do while working. 1. Is this the right move? Or are the top-tier, full-time programs (e.g., CMU, Berkeley MFE) so good that I should turn down my job to attend? 2. **For Quant Research:** What are the best part-time/online programs? I'm looking at **UChicago's MSFM** (online) or **NYU's Math Finance** (part-time). Are there others? 3. **For AI Research:** What's the best path here? * Is **Georgia Tech's OMSCS** (with an ML specialization) prestigious enough to help me pivot to a research role? * What about **UT Austin's MSDSO** or **UC Berkeley's MIDS**? * Is **Stanford's HCP** (part-time MSCS/MS Stats) my best bet, even if it means trying to transfer to a Bay Area office? 4. **PhD Long Shot:** I know my profile isn't competitive for a T10 PhD. Is it a complete waste of money to send 1-2 applications to my ""dream"" AI labs, or is there any chance my industry experience helps? 5. **Weak Spots:** How much of a red flag is my **3.5 AWA** or **156V** for these elite quant/stats programs, even with the 168Q?

Pick topics you’ll actually be asked in IB/ER/AM. * DCF (FCFF/FCFE), WACC, terminal value * Trading comps vs. precedents (normalising metrics) * M&A: accretion/dilution, sources & uses, purchase accounting basics * LBO drivers (IRR sensitivities), debt schedule intuition * Unit economics (contribution margin, payback) * Macro to valuation (rates/spreads to multiples/DCF) **Tip 2 — Use one answer template e.g.(C-A-E-R),** to make it easier to deliver your answer and guide you with every answer For every question, I used this structure, and found it really effective: * **Concept:** one clean line (“what it is”). * **Apply:** a tiny number/example (10–20s). * **Edge:** one limitation/nuance. * **Reflect:** the “so what” for the role/deal/market. **Example for LBO drivers:** * C: “IRR comes from entry/exit multiple, leverage, EBITDA growth, deleveraging.” * A: “+1x exit multiple adds \~5–7 pts IRR in a 5-yr hold (ballpark).” * E: “Multiple expansion is fragile in rising-rate regimes.” * R: “I’d test a no-expansion downside and check covenant headroom.” **Tip 3 — Practice these daily, even if it's just for 20-30 minutes a day,** to get comfortable with doing them Pick 2 topics from your syllabus 1. **Write 2 prompts** (see prompt list below) 2. **60s prep then 90–120s answer** (speak out loud, camera on if possible. I used a site called gradguru and just used their finance questions to practice this) 3. **Review your answer,** pointing out any things you missed 4. **Redo it** one more time, and then move on I've attached below some prompts that I used that are from real interviews, that will help you get familiar for the interview **Ready-to-use prompts** * Give me a clean **DCF walk-through** and one way it misleads. * **WACC components** — which inputs move value most and why? * **Terminal value:** Gordon vs exit multiple — pros/cons. * **Trading comps vs precedents** — when does each break? * A deal is **EPS-accretive** but value-destructive — explain. * **Sources & uses:** quick build and what you check first. * **Purchase accounting:** what changes day 1 and why EPS can shift. * **LBO IRR:** rank drivers by impact with a quick example. * Pick a company: **two KPIs** to track and why (investor lens). * **Rates up 100 bps:** what happens to multiples and to a DCF? I've attached a few tools that I used to practice for these interviews. Hope this helps! * **Kenji explains** on youtube**:** rehearse micro-calcs (WACC, TV, accretion) until automatic * **gradguru****:** good for timed, on-camera reps to simulate pressure, with 10's of technical questions and provides instant personalised feedback * **Macabacus** **/** **Investopedia****:** fast refreshers; read past the first paragraph",0.022,0.879,0.1,0.9909,pos

More sales reps, more output, more deals. But that plan collapsed fast because the cost didn’t make sense and I was drowning in manual work anyway. Out of frustration, I started experimenting with automation. I didn’t know much about it, but after about a week of research I began connecting a few tools that people seem to use. mainly Clay for research and enrichment, Notion to track deals, and Zapier to push updates around. Over time I stitched together a workflow that basically does what a whole SDR team used to do. Now it runs overnight. It pulls fresh company data, finds decision-makers, checks signals like hiring sprees or funding rounds, and builds me a short list of warm prospects by the time I wake up. I just handle the outreach and conversations myself. The craziest part is how human it still feels. It’s not spamming anyone or blasting templates, it’s just using data and timing better than I ever could manually.

I wasn’t looking for theory. I wanted to know which ones still get crawled, indexed, clicked, and approved in 2025. My quick sniff test was simple: the site had to be live, indexable, and visible in search for its own brand queries. Profile pages needed to show up in the HTML (not hidden behind JavaScript or 302 link masks), and approval couldn’t be a black hole. From there I scored each candidate on five things: how reliably profile URLs get indexed, how well the site matches a niche (SaaS/AI/dev/local), whether it has a real SERP footprint (do its category pages rank for anything?), any traffic signal at all, and how painful submissions are. A 70+ score was a “use it,” 50 - 69 meant “maybe, but check manually,” and anything below got cut. What actually holds up? Niche SaaS/AI aggregators that create a dedicated profile page and also tuck you into curated “best tools” roundups are surprisingly strong. Developer/product catalogs are solid too less volume, higher intent. Some startup directories keep an engaged audience via newsletters or X posts; those send little bursts of referral traffic and seem to speed up crawl on new domains. Local citations still matter if you have any local angle at all. And don’t sleep on community-maintained Notion/Airtable lists some of them rank for “best X tools” and quietly deliver clicks. What flops? Parked or resurrected domains built for ad arbitrage, “submission” flows that publish to templates marked noindex, JS-only links that never hit the source, and generic “1,000 links” farms with zero topical curation. If a directory doesn’t rank for its own name, it’s not going to help you. Out of the 5K, I ended up with roughly 420 “keepers” and \~700 “conditional” sites worth mixing in depending on niche and region; the rest weren’t worth touching. On a fresh domain, a paced run of keepers plus some conditionals typically gave me around 40 live listings within two weeks, 5 - 8 new links showing in Search Console, a 10 - 25% lift in referrals from long-tail lists, and those early brand queries that make everything else easier. None of this is a hockey stick it’s quiet infrastructure. But it compounds. Two things mattered more than I expected: pacing and variance. Don’t blast 500 submissions in a day; stagger over two to four weeks. Rotate a few versions of your description, lean on brand and partial-match anchors instead of exact-match spam, and keep 20 - 30% of the work manual add screenshots, tune categories, and ask for inclusion in the right collections. That “human randomness” seems to help with both approvals and indexing. Also, submit the right URL. If a list ranks for “best AI directory tools,” send people to the page that answers that intent your “How it works,” an FAQ, a comparison, or a lightweight free tool rather than dumping everyone on the homepage. Measurement-wise, treat approvals, published pages, and indexed pages as different milestones and track all three. I use GSC for Links/Pages and a lightweight analytics tool for referrals; last-click will miss some assists, so look at blended outcomes over a month, not a day. Once a month, prune dead profiles, refresh screenshots, and ask editors to drop your listing into curated roundups (that’s what actually gets clicked). And yes, nofollow profiles can still help discovery paths and brand queries are value, even when the attribute isn’t dofollow. If you want the exact scoring rubric (columns/weights) and a small sanitized sample of the “keepers,” say the word and I’ll share it based on the sub’s rules. Happy to trade notes on pacing, anchor mixes, or how to spot the long-tail directories that still pull their weight in 2025.",0.05,0.858,0.092,0.9792,pos

I noticed that something was flawed, took the concept, and executed it better. Here’s how it unfolded. A few months ago, I came across a tool that was charging hundreds of dollars to help “submit your startup to directories.” It seemed appealing at first a clean user interface and bold promises but the actual results were disappointing. Half of the directories were inactive, the founder wasn’t responding to support tickets, and users were expressing their frustrations on Reddit and X about how it didn’t work. Rather than complaining, I decided to rebuild the service faster, cleaner, and more reliable. I scraped over 5,000 directories, narrowed them down to about 400 that were still active and indexed, and created systems to handle the submission process automatically. Then, I added what I felt was missing: human oversight. Each submission was verified, duplicate checks were implemented, and a random manual audit ensured that the AI didn’t submit poor-quality listings. The result was GetMoreBacklinks.org a directory submission SaaS that automated 75% of the tedious work while still maintaining high quality. I launched modestly. There were no ads, no Product Hunt launch, and no influencer posts just me engaging in SEO and indie hacker discussions, sharing data, and being transparent. Results: Day 1: 10 paying users, Week 3: 100+ live listings, Month 6: $30K in revenue, All achieved by improving what someone else had only half-finished. The lesson? You don’t always need a brand-new idea. You just need to execute an existing one with care, speed, and genuine empathy for the user. If anyone is interested, I’m happy to share the list of directories that actually worked and the exact QA checklist I use before submitting.",0.065,0.77,0.164,0.9816,pos

We’re a 4-person remote crew running ads and storefronts in multiple regions (tariffs made our old setup way too expensive), so managing all the accounts securely became a nightmare, with various logins, constant IP flags, and ad accounts getting randomly banned. We improved our workflow around Multi-account management: a few months ago, we switched to AdsPower to manage everything in one place. Basically, it lets us create isolated browser profiles for each platform or market, each with its own fingerprint and proxy. Everyone on the team has their own access level, and I can track who’s logged in where. It's useful when you’ve got contractors in different time zones. We automated repetitive processes: when a new region/store opens, we spin up a profile, assign a team member, deploy a base ad campaign template, hook it into a tracker. For existing accounts we set up macros or scripts to check key metrics, pull snapshots and alert us if spend is under/over threshold. That saved us time (so the team can focus on strategy, creative and channels) and scaled without adding full-time hires. **My final take:** If you’re a small team trying to expand internationally or diversify channels (because tariffs or costs forced you to), you don’t need another overpriced platform or a 20-person ops team. What helps is: \- A tool that supports office automation (macro tasks, templates) \- One that enables secure multi-account management (we use AdsPower) \- One that supports remote team roles with access control and clear audit logs \- A system scaled so you can test new regions/channels without blowing your budget",0.034,0.84,0.126,0.9761,pos

(Tier-2 city perspective + lessons learned) Hi all, It has been a while since I've been talking honestly about this. I've been trying to manage a couple of different communities recently, but deep down, I remain connected with two things that I love, learning and food. On one end, I've initiated a small skill camp with a handful of students where we learn Data Structures & Algorithms just for the sake of pleasure and mental discipline. On the other, I'm operating a small food business in a tier-2 city (Ujjain). The last two years have seen me understand that I can't be ""pan-Indian"" as far as cuisine goes. That's too wide and random. Instead, I'm concentrating on Northeastern and super Northern cuisines, and also toning down and improving on what we do already do well South Indian food, Punjabi and Main Course foods, pre packed lunch on the move, Sandwiches and Breakfast Some of the platforms that have been instrumental to my success are Swiggy and Zomato they've enabled me to reach more people than I ever could have otherwise. If you're ever in Ujjain or Omkareshwar, you're more than welcome to stop by or have us cater for your party. ???? But I've also been dealing with a persistent issue that I know other food business folk can appreciate: > People ordering online solely to post fake complaints. They’ll order, eat, and then claim the food was “stale” or “bland” even when it wasn’t. Some even cancel after the food is dispatched, meaning the meal (and cost) is gone. I’ve started documenting such orders pattern-spotting the “crash” ones but responses from platforms remain lukewarm. The bigger issue, though, is consumer education. In tier-2 towns, individuals tend to have no exposure at all to proper Italian or other international food. For instance, I've been attempting to serve genuine Italian pasta and not the Indo-Chinese version everyone is accustomed to. But the locals somehow expect ""pasta"" to resemble chowmein with ketchup and chili sauce. When I present the actual aglio e olio or carbonara, they complain it is bland. How do you define ""authenticity"" to an audience that's been trained to believe ""fusion = flavor""? I've left pasta pre-made for now (testing waters), but will soon switch to handmade. Along the process, I've also introduced special drinks such as Panakam (which is apparently Lord Rama's favorite drink) and our Haatimaar Coffee a robust one which keeps you going for 8 straight hours. Here's what I would like to talk about: I'm operating with limited space, and I'm careful about growing too quickly. In smaller cities, room, personnel, and steady customer volume are actual challenges. So the question I have for the community is: How did you grow your food business (or any in-store setup) with minimal physical space without sacrificing quality or going out of business doing it? Would love to hear from anyone who has scaled economically in the F&B industry, particularly in smaller cities or towns with emerging food cultures. Thanks for reading and if anyone's traveling through Ujjain, the first Haatimaar Coffee is on me — Regards, Aaditya Goenka Goenka's Rasoi",0.039,0.829,0.132,0.9952,pos

Three person team trying to compete with firms that have 50 analysts. Felt impossible because we couldn't match their capacity for detailed work. The breakthrough was realizing we didn't need to match their resources. We needed to be faster and more efficient. Big firms have processes that take weeks because they involve 10 people and 5 approval layers. I spent 3 months ruthlessly eliminating waste from our workflow. Automated everything that could be automated. Standardized everything that repeated. Cut out steps that didn't add client value. Built out a proper tech stack. Endex handles standard model construction. Power query for data transformation. Tableau for client dashboards. Each tool does what it does best instead of forcing everything into excel manually. Now we deliver the same quality work in half the time. Clients love it because they get answers faster. We love it because we can take more projects without burning out.

Helped my friend automate his story content channel using n8n - he's saving 3+ hours daily My buddy started a short story channel on TikTok in March. The format works great for engagement but he was spending 4-5 hours per video and burning out fast. I've been messing with n8n for workflow automation lately so I offered to help. Took about two weeks to build out a system that handles the whole pipeline. The workflow breaks down like this: Story prompt comes in, GPT writes the script and splits it into scenes, another node generates slide designs for each scene, text-to-speech handles the voiceover, then everything gets stitched together with proper timing. Outputs a ready-to-post video. What I learned building this in n8n: The modular approach is perfect for content pipelines. Each step is its own node so when something needs tweaking you're not rebuilding everything. Way more flexible than trying to code it all from scratch. Error handling matters more than I expected. AI tools fail sometimes. Built in fallbacks and retry logic so the whole thing doesn't crash if one API hiccups. Cost optimization was interesting. Running everything through one workflow vs multiple helped cut API costs significantly. Also caching certain outputs that don't change much. The timing sync between slides and voiceover was the hardest part. Had to calculate durations dynamically based on text length and speech rate. Took way more iterations than expected. My friend went from barely keeping up with 2-3 posts a week to posting daily. Started a second channel. Actually has time to analyze what content performs and iterate on strategy instead of just grinding production.

Why this matters Scattered channels, slow responses, and manual follow-ups leak revenue and waste valuable time. This system centralizes every intake, automates context-aware outreach, and continuously learns from outcomes so your team spends less time on repetitive work and more time closing high-value opportunities. Core capabilities n8n-powered orchestration — modular, auditable workflows you can self-host or run in the cloud; full control over integrations and data flows. Unified multi-channel intake — collect leads and conversations from web, social, and email into a single smart pipeline. Gemini-driven content & replies — AI generates persuasive posts, context-aware responses, and personalized follow-ups that match each customer’s intent. Customer behavior intelligence — sentiment analysis, intent detection, and knowledge-base enrichment to understand and anticipate customer needs. A/B testing & analytics — automated split tests and weekly insights to scale what converts. Human-in-the-loop & compliance — complex or sensitive cases are escalated for review; PII (email, phone) is encrypted and retention rules are configurable. End-to-end commerce & CRM flow — auto-create leads in HubSpot, schedule bookings, and trigger payments via Stripe — all within the same workflow. Continuous improvement loop — feedback is logged to refine prompts and improve conversion performance over time. Business impact — what clients typically gain Dramatic time savings by automating routine outreach and follow-ups. Reduced operational costs through less manual labor and fewer missed leads. Higher conversion rates via personalized, timely engagement and A/B optimization. Deeper customer insight from sentiment and behavior analysis. Faster campaign rollout and predictable performance improvements. Who should consider this Ideal for small and medium businesses, marketing teams in mid-market companies, and relatively large organizations seeking a configurable, compliance-aware automation layer that unifies channels and drives measurable revenue.

Hi r/smallbusiness, As a company specializing in professional language translation, we encounter our fair share of AI translation failures that small businesses face. AI tools have come a long way since their inception, but they still struggle with the basics in translation. Here are a few common pitfalls we notice: 1. Literal translations that miss context: AI often translates word-for-word, which can make idioms, slang, or cultural references sound… awkward. For example, translating “kick the bucket” literally into another language will leave readers picturing someone physically kicking a pail. 2. Grammar chaos in complex sentences: AI can struggle with sentence structure, especially in languages with gendered nouns, cases, or multiple verb forms. The result? Sentences that technically “make sense” but read like a robot wrote them (because… well, it did). 3. False confidence: The most concerning part is when AI translates confidently but incorrectly. A wrong word choice in marketing materials, legal documents, or safety instructions can have real consequences for organizations, employees, or consumers. We love AI for personal communication and efficiency, but we always recommend human review even for small corporate projects to avoid misunderstandings or nonsensical translations. Context, nuance, and cultural understanding aren’t optional in professional translation: they are critical. We’d love to hear from you—what’s the funniest or most shocking AI translation fail you’ve seen recently?",0.139,0.678,0.183,0.9217,pos

It was our first real experience working with business owners and learning what they actually needed. During that time, I learnt a few things: * Most businesses don't need better looking websites, they needed more customers. * Even the best website meant nothing if no one was there to answer the phone or follow up. * Communication and accessibility mattered more than websites. I started to realize that the websites we built looked great, but they didn't fix the main issue, which was that websites weren't attracting or converting customers. A website can attract customers, but only if there is something that is actually driving people to it. This is a part that most business owners forget. A website is basically a front of a store. It can look clean and professional, but if nobody walks in the store, none of that matters. Most websites fail because they rely on hope: * No traffic coming in * No Follow up system * no automation * no one responding fast enough So even if the site looks good, it isn't doing anything for the business. That's when I realized design alone wasn't enough. Businesses needed a system that started conversations, captured leads, and followed up. Around that time, we discovered Ai, and we saw how people were using it to automate messages, calls, and followed up. After learning briefly about Ai, we decided to stop designing websites and start automating for businesses to fulfill their need of availability for clients. That's how we decided to start an Ai agency. **The First 6 months, what the website business looked like** **Months 1-2:** We spent the first two months learning how to design, build, host, and deliver a website. We were also asking people we knew if they had any referrals in need of a website and trying to get a case study. It was mostly trial and error, but it build the foundation for our eventual shift to Ai. **Months 3-4:** We finally landed our first client through a referral. It took us around a month to finish their website. Seeing that first payment hit our accounts was one of the best feelings, and it seemed like all the learning was worth it, and we were heading somewhere. **Months 5-6:** We started Cold calling to get more clients. A few people booked online meetings, but most never showed up. Even one of our potential clients we met with lost interest afterwards. This taught us that our business was not going to scale if we continued down this path. **What I learned from Web Design** 1. Websites are limited without automation. A visually appealing website doesn't mean much if it doesn't connect to real conversations. 2. Design earns trust, but results keeps clients. Good design can attract client, but communication is what keeps them connected. 3. Every business has the same main issue which is communication. Ai doesn't replace people, it just helps them respond faster on a more consistent basis and reduces their workload. **Day 1: The Setup** Day 1 was all about getting started. We brainstormed our business structure, built our agency website, finalized our name, and set up our main offers: * Ai Receptionist to answer calls instantly and operate 24/7. * Automation system to connect leads, websites, and dashboards. * Follow up Workflows to handle missed calls, unreturned messages, and follow up with potential and recurring clients. **Final Thoughts** Those six months in web design were fun and taught me hardships of business and what most business owners actually need which is not a great looking website, but having a system that helps them communicate better with clients and saves them time. By the end of the web design agency, I realized designing websites only goes so far. What really matters us how fast a business can respond, follow up, and stay connected with its customers. That's what led me to start exploring Ai not because it was trending around the internet, but because it actually solves the problems i kept seeing. Day 1 is just the first step toward building something that actually makes sense for how businesses really work.",0.056,0.844,0.099,0.9897,pos

If I could start over today, here’s what I would do… First off, so I don’t have to waste time with these responses: \-Yes I’m a little crazy. Whoopty Do! \-Yes I didn’t do it the way you would have done it. Oh snap, we have different brains and backgrounds? Groundbreaking stuff! \-Yes this is real, I did this all transparently on Reddit in real time from when I was doing $4k a month where the image starts with build in public, all the way to past $200k a month. Check the history through the years, you’ll find screenshots, me logging into my stripe with video lol, a tour of our office and warehouse, and everything in between. **Now that’s that’s out the way…** Here’s what I want to say. So I got here by doing things my way and not caring what the generally accepted startup methods were. I simply sold what people already by. **GENIUS!** But if I were to start over again here’s what I would say to a younger me: **DON’T DO ANY OF THIS.** **DON’T** Try to solve multiple things as opportunities pop up that could be complementary products to your main product. **DON’T** Launch without full validation testing while getting started. **DON’T** Skip the planning stages where you do full market research, economic research, SWOT analysis, where you take as much time as possible planning carefully and validating each product before you build. **DON’T** Put up a landing page and slap on a stripe checkout and try to get your first customer **DON’T** Launch before everything is perfect and every pixel in place. **DON’T** See startups as a numbers game where you put up as many shots as possible to see what works like you’re a venture capitalist distributing risk. **DON’T** Throw in the towel if something isn’t rolling within 60 days of launch and diligent marketing. **Don’t** Launch before testing demand as if you can infer demand from the fact that there are viable competitors making money. **Don’t** Focus on a slimmed down product and FAT marketing like…this is the path to success! Let me stop fucking with y’all. Re-read those last few sentences and cover up “Don’t”. **These things are EXACTLY what I would do all over again.** I’m not a genius. I’m not even great at business. Everything I learned I learned by doing and googling. And taking shots and learning along the way. (And this is enough to separate the winners from folks on the sidelines) **Do this instead (serious this time):** 1. Grab a one page business plan and write that idea out. 2. Make sure it’s something with viable competition. Boom: Validation done. 3. Get up a landing page (Takes like 10 minutes these days) 4. Set up your stripe or calendly (schedule a call) link 5. And get to marketing hitting all of these as close to daily as possible * Facebook Groups * Facebook Dms * Facebook profiles * Linkedin * Reddit * Twitter (Will forever be Twitter Fuck x) * Tik Tok * Instagram * Youtube Shorts Building a new tool for this btw. \^\^ If you don’t have some money from this in like 60 days, Fam, pivot and move on. You’ll learn a shit ton more from going through this a couple times that hanging out on the sidelines for the next decade. **SO WHAT WAS I THINKING IN DOING ALL THIS?** Fam, I was broke, hated my job, and wanted a way out of corporate America. The end. No magical dreams about changing the world. Wasnt’ trying to get clean water to Flint! My dreams were about my next car payment and finding the right a/c setting so it would kick on the exact perfect number of times where I could keep my electricity bill low enough while also not dying of heat stroke. And none of this is perfect. But life isn’t perfect. Imagine if folks overthought relationships like they overthought building businesses. Some of y’all would die alone lol **So that’s what I wanted to get out** * No you don’t need to get the tech perfected. * Nope that business plan doesn’t have to be 60 pages. What is this 1997? * Nope you don’t need funding (go build something that matches your bank account) Here’s what I’ve realized. Most aspiring entrepreneurs are **physically allergic to execution.** \-You’ve read every startup book. \-You’re in ten “founder” Discords. \-You’ve watched a thousand YouTube videos about passive income and scalability. \-You’ve even got a Notion doc labeled “2025 Business Ideas.” But you still haven’t launched a single thing. Why? Because you’ve confused *preparation* with *progress*. **You think startups are about perfect ideas — Startups are about** ***reps***\*\*.\*\* **Well that's just opinion any way, that doesn't make me right.** But my opinion is if you keep waiting for that perfect idea you’re going to keep getting trumped by people like me that put up reps. And now with AI the ability to put up reps is closer to once per week than it is once per year (like when i was starting out). **SO FINAL THOUGHTS** Take action. Overthinking and overplanning ttricks your brain into thinking you’re building something when you’re stuck in preparation mode. Instead, treat business content like a recipe — not a novel. If you want to cook a steak, you don’t spend five days reading Gordon Ramsay’s autobiography. You type “how to cook a perfect steak” into YouTube, hit play, and start searing. Medium rare of course. **Questions** I know my way isn’t the only way. I’m curious, for those of you who have been building for a while: If you had to start over, would you put up multiple shots and grind it out with one project? Would love to hear stories, lessons etc. All this is just one person's opinion at the end of the day. Dms are open too, I've been responding to all my Dms on here for over a decade.",0.06,0.816,0.124,0.997,pos

Still ended up raising from VCs and eventually moving to SF. The way I did it was basically brute-forcing a system for “warm intros” without actually knowing anyone. Quick context: At pre-seed I spoke with \~70 investors. At seed I spoke with \~175. 166 passed. **Expect to get at least 99 “no”s before the first “yes”.** At the beginning I did everything wrong... pitches too long, reached the wrong investors, no urgency, let investors decide timing, etc. Once I started treating fundraising like a numbers game instead of a “vibe game”, everything changed. The single hack that moved the needle the most for me: >**Instead of DM’ing investors, I DM’d portfolio founders first.** For every target VC, I went to their website → opened the portfolio → found founders in my sector → connected with them on LinkedIn. For each VC I would reach \~15 portfolio founders. 3 would accept a quick 15-min chat. And 1–2 ALWAYS ended up giving me a warm intro to their investor. Why this works: When the investor gets your deal from their own founder, they treat you like you’re already “in the round”. It instantly creates urgency and flips the power dynamics. It makes them think “others are already in if I wait, I might lose the deal”. Also: fundraising is 50% how strong your company is, and 50% how well you *run* the process. Urgency beats raw traction. If you compress investor conversations into a dense window, you'll be able to build FOMO, which is the driver behind all the rounds you see out there where you feel like ""how the f...k those guys raised that much with no traction...!!"". If you rise going for 1 call per week, nothing will happen. Fundraising felt like a full-time job on top of running the startup. But this process gave me a repeatable way to constantly generate warm intros and keep momentum alive. Later, because so many founders kept asking me about this, I built EasyVC, using AI to do the heavy lifting (finding the right investors + automating outreach to portfolio founders on LinkedIn). But the manual version above already works if you grind it. Happy to answer questions!",0.03,0.866,0.104,0.9718,pos

Here’s what happened/how I'm managing. Background: I run a small international snack brand called Pop Snax, which I started 2 years ago. Initial operations were out of my apartment where snacks took up every inch of space, lol. I've grown steadily over the last year, and I'm now working out of a co-warehouse space. Anyway, last Sunday, something wild happened. A huge influencer (Joe Bartolozzi) who randomly ordered one of my mystery snack boxes in August, unboxed it on stream. Had no idea who he was so I had no idea he was even placing an order. Within hours, my website traffic exploded. Shopify was dinging nonstop.. I got over 300 orders in two days. I was super confused at first and asked a customer how they found me, and that's when I found out about the influencer unboxing. I cried almost constantly for the first 2 days bc this was one of those surreal “this is actually happening” moments, and I had no idea what I'd done to deserve this. Since last Sunday, orders have been heavy and consistent and the video featuring my box has hit 850k views! While running the business, I also work a full-time job, so, I've been running on fumes trying to keep up with customer emails, packing, and fulfilling, often late into the night. It's been exciting, but also kind of chaotic. Anyway, this viral moment has given me my first real taste of HEAVY demand at scale, but its also exposed how under-resourced I am as a solopreneur. I don’t have a team yet, or fulfillment support, and I’m still figuring out how to maintain that momentum after the viral wave calms down. Even with the boost, I know growth won't be linear. There’s still the day-to-day grind I'm trying to figure out, i.e. running ads, improving packaging, managing costs, dealing with platform issues (looking at you, Amazon 😅), and trying to make every customer happy. I'm trying to get deep into AI, so I can offload some of that pressure/manual oversight. Feel free to ask me anything!

When the company shut down, our Discord community mostly stayed active even though many people left. I recently decided to give prompt-based automation another shot, rebuilt the platform from community feedback but instead of starting from 0, I thought I'd message the power users from our old Discord. Well, first of all the Discord community is fully dead now - and none of the old power users in the Discord seem to be responsive in DMs either. But then, THE most active power user replied to me. We had a chat, he gave some great feature suggestions from the latest tools - which I have added - and I was thinking YES!! FINALLY, a warm lead!

So here's the breakdown of my current system, totaling $52 per month: **General purpose:** * **GPT ($20):** Still using chatGPT for general purposes, content, emails, learning new knowledge and image creation. But now consider cutting this and move to Gemini. * **Gemini, Perplexity ($0):** I use the free version when I need to get different perspectives **Productivity:** * **Manus ($0):** This is the easiest AI agent for me so far, just tell it the request and go. I use it for deep research * **Fathom ($0)**: This is for meeting notes, still use the free plan cause it's decent enough * **Saner ($12):** I use it to manage notes, todos, calendar via chat and plan my day * **Grammarly ($0):** To fix my grammar on typing across all the apps and interface, save more time than copying text to chatGPT **Marketing:** * **v0 (20$):** using this to create my website, just switched from the free to the paid plan cause I have more requests for the site. This is really valuable tbh * **Canva ($0):** I'm using Canva for doing most of the marketing assets. It's so easy to make stuff and the AI is making image creation kinda faster Some other mentions are Sora, Veo3... but I haven't found a way to get good ROI from them Total Cost: $52 per month (for now) Hope this helps anyone looking to find tech tools for their business, productivity.

I have zero control over how people react. It's terrifying. **2. Shipping gives instant dopamine. Marketing/research feels like screaming into the void** There's this incredible feeling when you roll out a feature you've worked on for weeks. You see it work. You feel accomplished. But marketing? Half a day of research results in a few notes in Notion. Zero visual feedback. Boring AF and frustrating. **3.

Our biggest clients: * Jewelry tech agency: 300k calls * Marketing agency (retail brands focused): 200k calls * Fintech company: 100k calls * Others making up the rest Most of our growth came through agency partnerships. But here's **something I learned** the hard way: you can't mold your entire company around one client. Early on, we almost made that mistake. An agency wanted us to customize everything for their specific workflow. We started doing it. Then realized we were becoming THEIR product, not ours. If you're too fine tuned to one client, you're not a company anymore. You're a vendor stuck in their ecosystem. We pulled back. Told them we can offer white label options where they can sell under their own brand without mentioning superU. We keep it premium. We don't show our name. They get what they need, but we don't rebuild our entire product for them. Some clients didn't like that. That's fine. Better to lose a client than lose your company's direction. The agencies that stuck around appreciated it. They came to us with custom needs, and we helped them fit it into what we already do well. That's the balance. Finding these agencies happened mostly through Reddit and SEO. Reddit took about 50 - 60 posts in last 4 months. A few posts blew up, brought traffic, and that traffic turned into conversations. SEO was steadier. LinkedIn helped too, but only when we stopped using automation. I started going through profiles one by one. Looked at their work. Crafted personal messages.

One afternoon, I was sitting outside working on my product (a financial education app for children, relevant for the story) trying to decide on the visual style for our cards. These cards (think Pokémon cards) are a fundamental part of the app so took some time and played with different AI image generators to find the visual style I was after. At some point my kids, and soon the other kids (ages 6–11), came over, curious about what I was doing. What started as a quick “look at this” moment turned into a full-on user testing session. First, I showed them a few design options and made a mini survey to see which one they liked most. At some point, they started asking questions: “What’s this app for?” “Can I try it?” So I explained what it is about and how it helps kids build money habits and even grow their pocket money through small, real actions etc.. They LOVED IT! One girl, whose parents are really strict about screens, even tried to convince her dad to install it for her, even though it’s not ready yet. I overheard it a little bit after the ""session"" ended and felt so proud. That moment wasn’t planned, but it made me feel like we’re building something that can truly add value and help people.",0.006,0.874,0.12,0.9774,pos

Hopefully one day it’ll be useful to others who are starting out. A bit of background about myself. I’ve wanted to start a business for the last 10+ years. I’ve halfheartedly “started” before but always gave up too soon. Initially I learned HTML/CSS/PHP. However I have a tendency to got distracted by a new language or framework, and tutorials. The cycle is fairly consistent. Discontentment at work -> watch tutorials -> register a URL -> Things get better at work -> project dies. My current day job is industrial electrical maintenance. Over the years I’ve learned a lot about PLC programming and HMI design. Basically the “computers” and interfaces that make modern manufacturing possible. The work is challenging and rewarding. Getting into manufacturing shifted my interest from starting a web based business to starting a manufacturing business. However, this is a pretty unrealistic goal for someone with little capital and a full time job. I’ve tried designing a product for 3D printing which has had zero interest other than among friends and family. I also considered a few woodworking related projects but I don’t know the first thing about woodworking. Earlier this year I joined a business course/cohort targeting people in my general industry. Going through the course has been great as I’ve been able to spend time reflecting on what’s important to me while learning about business. During the course, many of my peers suggested I start an industrial automation or consulting company. This would fit my skill set but not my goals. A lot of advice online says to start a business in an area you have expertise in. This makes sense but I was only looking at it from the perspective of doing actual automation and programming work. When I’m stuck on a problem at work I often find myself turning to search, YouTube, and forums. Often it can be hard to find answers and the ladder logic examples are gated behind logins. If I’m having these issue surely others are. I’ve also had challenges making nice graphics for HMIs, I ended up learning a different piece of software to do this. I couldn’t find much info on using this software in my industry. I also ran into a programming task that required automation and the info online was to use a spreadsheet with formulas or write a python script. This is something most programmers will need to do from time to time. Those three struggles have given life to the concept of my business. A website with content released in phases. Phase 1) A blog where I write articles relating to different problems I’ve faced with code examples. I’ll also include files for some of the 3D printed tools I’ve created. The goal of the blog will be to provide free value and drive traffic. I have had moderate success before (traffic not monetary) when I went through an affiliate marketing phase. Phase 2) Releasing a software product that automates the task that normally requires spreadsheets or python knowledge. I’ll offer a monthly and yearly option. This is a product that can be expanded over time but the basic functionality will be valuable on its own. Phase 3) A paid course on utilizing that particular software to design HMI graphics. There is a lot of content around this software already but having something specific for HMIs will make it easier for programmers to get up to speed. I’ve often read the phrase “the riches are in the niches”. And this is certainly a niche. Focusing on PLCs/HMIs. And to drill down another level I’m only going to focus on the brand that I’m most familiar with. If anyone reading has words of wisdom or criticism of my concept I’d love to hear it.

Most business owners know reviews are important, but many don’t realize how much **consistent reviews and responses can boost local SEO**. When your profile shows steady activity, new reviews, and quick replies, it ranks higher in searches and makes customers more likely to trust you. Responding to reviews, even the bad ones, signals that your business actually cares. We’ve designed this to be completely set it and forget it on your end. My team handles the setup, automation, review monitoring, and responses. If you want, we can also include TextBlasts to reach out to past clients for more reviews. You just add any new clients if we’re doing TextBlasts, and we handle everything else. You get a dashboard to track progress, but you don’t have to touch it if you don’t want to. Right now, we’re taking on a few test clients at a low, affordable rate. Since running TextBlasts and AI review responses adds real costs, we’re letting early users name a fair price in exchange for feedback and a testimonial.

Here's the journey. The Problem I Had: 6 months ago, I needed customers for a project. I'm technical, not a marketer. I tried everything: * Cold emails (2% response rate, felt like spam) * Reddit posts (got banned for ""self-promotion"") * Twitter broadcasting (crickets) * Paid ads ($300 wasted, wrong audience) What Finally Worked: Manually finding people who were actively looking for solutions: * Someone tweeting ""I need help with customer acquisition"" * A founder posting in r/SaaS asking for lead gen tools * A launch on Product Hunt that aligned with my ICP I'd reach out, help them, mention what I was building if relevant. Conversion rate: 20-30% (way better than mass outreach) The Problem: This took 3-4 hours a day. Manually searching, reading context, crafting personalized messages. I thought: ""There has to be a better way."" So I Built It: Ralix — an AI assistant that automates the ""finding"" part: * Monitors Twitter, Reddit, forums for buying signals * Identifies highly-qualified prospects based on recent activity * Helps you craft personalized outreach that references their context Basically: What I was doing manually, but faster and smarter. The Build: * Started in April * Went heads-down for 6 months * Rewrote the onboarding 4 times * Almost gave up twice * Launched today Current Status: * 30 people on waitlist (freebies awaits them) * Nervous and excited Tech Stack: (for the curious) * Backend: Python FastAPI, Supabase * Infra: CloudFlare Pages for frontend, CloudFalre worker for backend proxy. Hetzner for backend hosting * AI: Gemini 2.5 Pro for personalization and sentiment analysis/signal detection * Frontend: React, Tailwind What I Learned: 1. Precision > Volume — 50 targeted leads beats 1,000 random ones 2. Timing > Message Quality — Right person, right time matters more than perfect copy 3. Solo building is lonely — but also gives you complete control 4. Launch anxiety is real — even when you know the product works Not trying to hard-sell, but if you're a founder struggling with customer acquisition, I built this for you.

Really learning about people’s ability to circulate within a product’s lifecycle. Eventually a customer will be unhappy if they will come into a product lifecycle and come out unhappy anyway, and was it necessary to put your team through the duration of that stress of being unable to meet the demand of the customer, because they don’t know what they want, nor do they have the ability to comprehend the end of what they want, and they will just remain unhappy.

Still, I’ve put together a strategy: I chose a specific niche and decided to write in Spanish so I can reach more countries. I’m also using structured data in all my posts. Besides that, I created an Instagram account where I’ll post carousels and regular content, and a Twitter account where I’ll share tweets related to the topics I cover on the blog. My idea is to drive traffic to the blog, grow my social media, and sell an e-book across all these channels while also earning from AdSense.

Our clients are big international brands with every detail already calculated on their side. They hand us the plans, we execute and report. No real strategy input, no ownership, and we don’t get access to actual business results. So I have no idea if what I’m doing is even impactful just launching safe media plans and overachieving on basic KPIs. This is my 3rd year working in general. Before WPP, I was at an outsourcing company representing Snapchat for SMBs. And it was just get clients to spend money and call it a day. Recently I’ve been feeling strongly that I want to shift into the gaming industry ,something I’m actually passionate about. I don’t know exactly which role fits me yet, but I know I don’t want to spend my life doing work that doesn’t excite me. TL;DR: • Media execution isn’t fulfilling, zero strategy, zero visibility on results • I want to move into gaming (strategy / partnerships / business side maybe?) • I’m considering building a small website to showcase gaming market research & insights For anyone who has made a similar shift: – What roles should I target first? – What portfolio or skills helped you break in? – Any certs / networking tips specific to gaming?

Came to a head a couple of weeks ago when my son decideded that he wanted to apply for universities in Scotland to live near and with his grandparents, rather than universities in England. This didn't jive with what his girlfriend wanted him to apply to. She either faked or purchased a fake pregnancy test online or from a friend (we're not sure where yet) and began pestering him over messenger with a stream of vague messages designed to induce anxiety. ""This is bad..."" ""This is really bad, Jacob."" ""I don't know what I'm going to do now..."" Loads of messages like that with an undertone that she might be pregnant. She then ignored his calls and replies, just continuing to be vague, as well as taking time off school. Her friends also joined in on this on the third day of it both in messages and in-person in school. Eventually on Thursday her friends and her (all 16 years old) revealed that she was pregnant with an image of a positive pregnancy test. We not know this to be fake. This was accompanied by messages from her and her friends that he needs to ""step up"" and do the right thing. Agree to go to university with her.

As well as drinking a full bottle of wine. He was taken to A&E and was treated. Police were also called. We found the messages on his phone and he has since explained more of what happened to us.

This resulted in the girls mass-deleting old messages while we were screenshotting them. Police did not arrive in time to get the phones and stop this from happening. We were ringing police live as this was happening saying they're deleting and destroying evidence. In the past week the girls have been given detentions. That is it. Additionally, the police have said that faking a pregnancy is not actually a crime so there is nothing to charge them with. They suspected they might be able to do something under Malicious Communications, but the messages had been deleted and the girls and their solicitors collectively said we'd made those screenshots using AI and that they weren't real.

Hi all, I’ve been handling a tenancy-deposit claim myself and would really appreciate views on whether I should bring in a solicitor at this stage. • Rent: ~£4k/month (London) England • Tenancy: June 2024 – June 2025 • Deposit: £4.5 k, never protected • Managed by a major London agent • We lived there full-time with a newborn; our own house was uninhabitable and under a JCT Minor Works contract The tenancy agreement was labelled “contractual” instead of an AST and even included a clause saying any dispute had to go through a paid ADR scheme costing £600 split 50/50. The agent later said this meant the Housing Act 2004 didn’t apply and the deposit didn’t need protecting. I’ve filed a County Court claim under the Housing Act. The landlord’s solicitor has offered 1× deposit + return + my court fee; I’ve countered at 2.5× for deliberate non-compliance. They say they’ll file a defence by 31 Oct 2025. I’ve done everything myself (with help from generative AI for research/structure, not formal advice). Questions: 1.

I'm sorry if this will be long. But it require details. So, in 2022 I lived for 7months at a temporary flat in London,it was a temp contract because I had just received news of redundancy at work and I didn't knew what I was going to do, at the end I decided to move next to Manchester where I lived for the entire year 2023.i left London in December 2022 and in January I was already working for same company other contract. While in london, when I started the search for new job, new house and potentially a new city, I did realize I didn't have no proof of address, my ex partner had All on his name because he did take care about house search and contracts, in those days I was working and he was in holiday. I was working night shift so he was the one up during the day. So we had brilliant idea to try and switch name on contract with ovo energy. We had first call, we did this request and then they did ask for my details which I gave and spelled for the customer service lady. From this point on we stopped to receive letters, if not for one but with a name that was similar to mine, but not mine and not even same gender. In the middle of name and last name there was a letter, like a second name, but I have none. When I tried to get inside ovo's account online my email wasn't accepted. My ex partner's one neather. We tried to call something like twice a week for a month and half but no one could manage to spell my name correctly and I was keeping being rejected by the page's login system because my email (which start with.. My name...!)it was probably being misspelled too.... And I had no idea on how they could have misspelled it. At the end we managed to pay because of the @automated emails arriving to my ex partner with the bill incorporated and my ex still had the details for payment in his bank account to provide the payment. We left in December and my ex called ovo and communicated the closure for this contract a week before to leave. I've got back in london in january 2024 after the second redundancy. Fast forward to this year, I receive a letter and email by a lawyer firm that ask me for bit less than 2k, speaking of a date starting from start contract in 2022 to a not defined date in 2023. I answered, engaged with it, told this, and sent file pdf for signed version Rent contract in Manchester area. Lawyer tell me he can't see part of it. So I Send unsigned copy pdf, he declared the same. They brought me in court and I tried to defend myself but I failed because of late answer, in my defense, I did pass a week trying to find a lawyer around me, all of them told me they weren't treating the matter or Tht they couldn't help me at ""that phase"", then someones told me about the llsw society and I did put more than a week for an appointment. I'm ignorant in this matter so I need help for this. Now I have the bailiffs behind the corner and what upset me is that I don't even owe them money at all, by the credit file it result they're asking me for January to March 2023, where I was phisically in another place. I have payslips, medical appointments, a surgery, rent contract as proof. Now I'm forced to pay with llsw enforcement. Can I make a court claim to ask them back what is been paid up to that point and compensation for stress and inconvenience caused? I'm currently in phase of new waiting list with nhs therapy, and I'm stressing badly on this situation even tho I don't owe them money. What and how to do it? Thanks Edit to add this. I tried to Seek legal help since first day, I called and visited dozens of firms and professionals and WHEN they did answer, they said they couldn't help me at any stage I tried to ask. And as last joke, last one I did call last week, told me it was the result of not to seek legal advice before. Really a shame.",0.081,0.857,0.062,-0.902,neg

That refund has never been issued. I’ve spent days on phone/live chat with different agents trying to get it resolved and I just keep getting bounced around. Separate issue — staff gave me false info about a failed order: Before this PS5 order there was a failed order. Currys staff told me the failure was my bank’s fault. That turned out not to be true — the payment actually left my account and later got e-mail from currys automated confirming the issue was on their side. I wasted time contacting the bank because staff insisted it wasn’t Currys. Eventually that order was refunded, but the misinformation caused a lot of hassle. So far: Hours across multiple days on calls and chats Spoken to multiple agents (Philile and Saaj among others) No escalation, no written explanation, no refund Staff made clear promises at point of sale which are not being honoured What I want from Currys: The refund I was promised Written explanation why it hasn’t been issued Assurance they won’t mislead other customers Compensation for time/stress given how long I’ve spent chasing something I was clearly promised Questions for the sub: What is the most effective next step — letter before action? Section 75? ADR? Is this a breach of contract given assurances at point of sale? Is there any regulatory body (e.g. ASA, Trading Standards, Ombudsman) that is appropriate for this type of misrepresentation / refusal to honour price-match promises?

Here's a brief snapshot of my situation: * 32M * \~$80K gross income * $70K cash, + $21K in a Roth IRA for a possible home purchase * $60K 401K, $20K HSA - I receive limited matches on both * $15K in Nvidia stocks currently * possible $10K in added family support I live in an area that is stepping up into a MCOL environment. My job is mostly remote. Despite that, I live 15 minutes from my office today in a very appealing and walkable area with a lot of job opportunities. It's hard to walk away from, but housing here would be $340-360K with light work attached to it ($15K on average). Conversely, I could buy more home within 45 minutes of my office in a neighboring small town for $250-270K or just rent in my current area for $1,500/month. Any of these leave me within an hour of my entire family. I'm struggling because I have so much flexibility in this moment and my finances can handle a purchase but not so easily that it's the obvious move to everyone. I like the idea of being self-sufficient and building equity, but I'm a white-collar analyst who feels at risk from AI and worry that I could get caught out without a job in 5-10 years' time. I know there's plenty more in the med-long term that I shouldn't try to predict, but I can't help it! I am also open to income options to improve my standing in any event (second job, roommate, etc.) What would you do in this situation? What advice would you have for me? Here are my options again: A) Buy in an area I like with optimal opportunities for more (\~55% housing costs to net income after 20% down) B) Buy better/more for less at the expense of social opportunities (and a longer commute if I ever get called back to the office) C) Rent and see where things go D) None of the above. I could always go far away and avoid a local RTO call, no matter what I do. I appreciate any feedback and can answer questions as needed. Thanks! EDIT: Based on the feedback, I will go with renting. I felt that was likely the right choice in my gut, but I was getting with enough counter-arguments and viable (but perhaps not optimal) housing options to make me second guess myself.

I am now 40 in Dec 25, and a married father of 2. My wife and I both work full time. She gets a pension, and I have a 401k(r), and I also get stock bonuses at my employer. I have about $200k in my 401, and just under $9k of fully vested employer shares. My agreement offers me more every year that vest each partially year over 3 years. Vesting is based on company performance. I do budget, and I have a ton of room to improve in some categories where I keep overspending, but that is another topic for another day. I have about $31k and change in liquid savings. This is where I need advice. I have been asking AI tools for some to make a plan to pay off debt. I want to get to $50k savings, but I'm starting to wonder if I need to table that while I chip away at debt. Is it worth it to take, maybe $6k, to pay off 2 credit cards. Then take those payments to snowball my 3rd card. As soon as that is done, snowball a student loan, and then finally snowball the HELOC? I worry that $25k is not enough of a safety net, I could probably stretch it to 3 months if I reallllllly cut back.

Essentially, who are your financial gurus who have had success in both the “red and blue pill” versions the matrix? 🤦‍♀️😂 I’m not looking for a cookie cutter accountant, another self-interested investment “advisor,” an IG course salesman, just someone wise and experienced who can help ensure that investments, taxes, life choices, and high level game plans are optimized for these incredibly confusing times. Long version: I've worked really hard and I'm blessed to have my basic needs met, but I'm in-between in every area of my life. Things are changing rapidly and while some things require lingering in the “in between” (dating, starting a family, etc.), other windows will close before I even realize it. I’m glued to alt news, X, etc. and trying to constantly interpret what all of these changes mean for me and how to play them, but it’s enough to drive anyone insane. A snap shot of what I'm working with and the types of things I (and likely many others) are contemplating are below. I've already done a ton of research and built a handful of scenarios, but the decision tree is looking more like a dark forest and I can't afford to bet my life’s savings off of my gut and chatgpt alone. - [ ] I’m a 35 yo newly single female, w2 employee, renting in a major city - [ ] I’m not young enough to make a clean career pivot or old enough to just hang on until retirement, AI’s coming for me sooner rather than later, but I'm wary to go all in on creating a company/ new career or even switching jobs when I need to be laser focused on my personal life - [ ] I’ve got a good deal of company stock, but I can’t touch it until I figure out my tax shelter situation. I also have a good deal in my 401k that I don’t trust the fed not to gamble with, but I need a baked strategy before I meddle with it. - [ ] Renting (under rent control) and staying in a major city makes sense as far as meeting someone and maintaining career— but the flexibility & possibilities also inhibit my ability to make interim decisions on investments, finance, etc. - [ ] I’ve watched friends take advantage of the low interest rates under Obama, or get in during the pandemic and I cant afford to sit out on the BBB plays. Hell, I didn’t get the white picket fence I wanted (yet), so I should at least play my lack of family/ roots status to my favor and get creative, right? I have enough to make 1-2 mild bets, but I need this expert to help me determine which 1-2 are the best (juggling dozens of scenarios at the moment) and pressure test them to ensure I don't miss anything. - [ ] Every time I set a goal/strategy it’s upended by a major change to “the game” as we knew it. Sure, the system isn't built for “us,” but I'm not completely powerless, resourceless, or ready to retire to some homestead all by myself. Im no economist, but I’m also not an idiot. That said, Im smart enough to know that I absolutely cannot afford to bet my life’s savings on a strategy co-authored by ChatGPT alone. At the same time, continuing to contribute to the economy and reap little from it— while the game is being actively rewritten— seems equally as determinantal.

I believe a *serious* crash is coming. I have no idea when, of course. I've never looked seriously into gold for all the trad reasons; it's not a productive asset, the fundamentals are a joke, your money goes further in the stock market, etc etc etc. but lately I've been seriously considering a hedge against the US economy (or rather, the way the government has been going about things) - and I realize Gold's average annual yield for *many* years tends to meet or exceed even a decent HYSA. So, long story short - I'm looking to invest about 15% of my NW in physical gold using funds from my HYSA. It does *not* replace a rainy day fund but it's absolutely money that could be invested. I am simply looking for a hedge against the system itself, because I think there are strong indicators that we will see it collapse and reset within our lifetime. I've researched gold and I know it comes with its own challenges (resell, storage, reputable sellers, sometimes cap gains etc) but still consider it valuable in this landscape.

One that might not appreciate the most in bull markets, but one that would appreciate well in recessions and market crashes. **What assets are known to appreciate in US recessions and market crashes?** So far, I've added gold certificates and bond funds to act as a cushion in my portfolio. **My thought process for gold is the following:** Gold tends to appreciate heavily during market crashes/recessions historically. Further, if the current US administration continues to pressure and take control of the FED. I believe trust in the handling the dollar would decrease. For example, unchecked interest rate cuts, and unchecked printing of money would cause investors to no longer view the dollar as safe haven, and move to gold as a safer asset that cannot be inflated. **My thought process for bond funds is the following:** Bond funds tend to appreciate during rate cuts, which are likely to happen in a US recession/market crash, or if the US administration takes control of the FED.

I'm real flesh and blood and I wrote this with my own fingers in a distressed state- no AI help or anything. I'm not sure how this comes off as fake. I'm articulate and have had a lot of time to think and piece it together coherently, is that so rare these days?? I'm so confused. How else could I have come to ask for help in this situation? Go on my profile to see what else I write, hell you can even hear me sing. The responses here have worsened my faith in the acting industry. If ya'll were a jury I'd be fucked. A lot of the comments have been taken down by moderators but they still have an impact. * Took a special interest in me and kept me back in class to talk. This became a regular thing and at first, I was flattered by his attention. My classmates were jealous and called me the 'queen of movement' because I do have a natural ability. One person dropped out because she was sick of the favouritism. Fair enough, I would have too. He began contacting me over email and text mostly with relevant stuff and contacts * He found out that I pole dance and his face lit up. He found out about a pole dance showcase I was doing and, despite my hints for him not to come, he came. I felt like bc he bought an expensive ticket, I had to go spend time with him in the audience so I did. He pulled me to the back at the bar and kept trying to buy my a drink and asking to leave to go to a bar with me- trying to engage me in conversation while all my friends were performing on stage and I was missing them. I kept saying no and trying to redirect my attention to the stage and he kept saying things like ""after this year you'll never see me again"" and i was confused thinking ""what are u trying to bait me into saying??"" But I was silent and said 'oh ok'. He said ""you're not saying anything. I'm trying really hard here"" and i said ""I'm just processing whats happening right now"" and he tried touching my face and asking what its like kissing my boyfriend (I don't have one and never told him of one) and telling me how sexy/beautiful I am with makeup on and getting far too touchy on my knee and stuff, telling me how I reminded him of his daughter (fkn gross). He told me about how he needs ""women"" to feel inspired creatively and told me about how much he has cheated on his wife- as if he was boasting and inviting me to be his next mistress or something. I remained silent but I looked at him and felt sad ""this guy is such a loser"" I thought and I pitied him * Since then, I have detached and avoided him and after the first class back from that event, he chased me down the road after class and said ""you seem upset with me whats wrong"" and I said ""nothing"" and walked off. I wanted to leave no more room for emotional intimacy or familiarity, I wanted to return to being simply a student. * In every opportunity in class he has had to touch me, he has. Put his finger through mine (in a very sexual way like finger-through-hole), touched my neck, requested a kiss on a cheek... * Recently in a class he walked in with a foul mood- apparently, he had little faith in the end of year performance and was fresh out of inspiration. I wonder if it was because I had given him such little attention or wiggle room. He then turned on me in front of everyone saying ""you have everything it takes to be a great actor but you're burning yourself out and you have some deep emotional issues and you need to let go more""- all which is valid when said tenderly in private but it was aggressively while i stood on stage under a spotlight in front of my whole gossipy class. It felt like he was blaming or me or trying to humiliate me, thinly veiled under care. Funnily enough the class got jealous of how much attention I got and then asked him do a ""cold hard psychoanalysis"" on them too. * After that class I contacted the director of the acting school to pull out of the class and he convinced me to stay without knowing the full story. * In the next class, he tackled me to the floor to demonstrate a 'pretend kiss' and he said ""stop resisting"" and I said ""well i don't want it to happen"" and he went ahead and did it anyway. Whenever he touched me, this gross look of satisfaction would set into his face. Whenever he touched me I felt deeply disturbed and like he was taking something from me, even if energetically. I've lost sleep from feeling so disturbed, I would often lose sleep and feel enraged * I contacted him via text the next day saying ""please don't touch me again and please don't attack my character publically, any critique you have can you please focus on my work. I want to feel like the classroom space feels respectful and professional"" and he took HUGE offence to it, and suggested he ""wouldn't care if you chose to pull out fo the end of year performance"". I got the director involved who said my text was far too direct and not diplematic and that ""if you had of sent me that text and I'd hired you for a set then I'd fire you"". So then, in my defence, I told him the full story, he was appalled by this teacher's conduct and sorry for my experience but convinced me to continue with the performance. But my heart isn't in it. I feel fundamentally unsafe and unhappy in the class. I don't believe in my pieces and I never want to see this guy again. I feel like I've learnt as much as I could from him. His style of performance is cartoonish and showy whereas I'm more subtle and deep so theres that misalignment of approaches and taste too. The pieces that I have been given to perform for the end of year performance... I do not like. I have to wear a big plastic mask for 2 of them (I have sensory issues), there's elements of tasteless perversion, profound misogyny and it's generally got a weird feeling - the show in it's entirety. Last class, the teacher said ""I want this to be a very sexy play... like not overtly sexy but you know when you can see the line of a womans underwear when she wears a short skirt and its somehow more sexy than her just in underwear? I want it to be like that"". The concept of the show is an outline of heteronormative 'life' and elements of falling in love, dying, birth, having sex etc. It's very basic and outdated. I kinda feel sick by the whole thing. He keeps blowing smoke up his own ass talking about all the awards he has received. He showed us Slav's Snowshow on yt as a reference and if we were to do something as awesome as that, I'd be so down but it really doesn't feel like its coming together even close. It's far too pervy. Other pieces include a 'sex scene' and a scene where one of the new students (she's only 19) has to be in underwear while a male undresses her on stage. What are your thoughts? I know the industry is full of weirdos like this and I don't want to be a pansy who just pulls out when she's uncomfortable but I've been having insane panic attacks at 4am, getting no sleep, feeling really stricken with weird feelings.... the thought of leaving it brings me a profound sense of peace. Though I feel sad to leave it, abandon my scene partner.... this was going to be the performance I was going to finally reveal to my parents ""I've been doing acting all year! Look at this!"" and I'll be abandoning that vision too. Also don't want the director to think ill of me and have that affect my career and opportunities. He's very judgemental and a narc too. I need help figuring out what to do, I've got to many emotions and brain fog clouding my ability to see this clearly. Thank you for taking the time to read through all this, I really appreciate it.

I had great experiences and now that I live in LA I’d like to do it here too, but Grant Wilfley doesn’t operate in LA. The way that site worked was that I could go on daily and submit myself for any specific show and date that I was available for, and I would hear back if they wanted to book me. There was no AI scan/in perpetuity BS because it was 2022 and early 2023. I’m nonunion. Is there any comparable service in LA? I have read how Central Casting works and it sounds like there is no ability to submit yourself for specific projects? Do I have that right? Any kind advice would be appreciated. Thank you! Edit: Can I submit my availability so I don’t get texts for times I can’t make it due to work? Also curious how the scan thing works- would Central Casting keep my scan, or is it owned by the studio?

The Same Industry That Already Replaced Bands With Ghostwriters Most of the “AI music bad” takes are aimed at the wrong target, and what happened with Udio just proved it. Labels are not trying to stop AI, they are trying to own it. They will use it anyway because it is cheap and powerful. So the real question is not “should AI learn from music?” because that is how humans learn. The real question is: who gets to have a model that learns at scale? People talk like we still live in the era where a real band could grind, get radio, get a label deal and break through. That era is mostly gone. It has already been replaced by product artists fed by the same small pool of ghostwriters, faceless songwriting factories making safe hits. That is the system shouting “AI is bad,” which is a bit ironic. If we shout “ban AI music” in a broad way, small artists do not win. Rights holders do. They become the only ones who are legally allowed to train on big catalogs. We get a nerfed “remix these 30 approved artists” theme park, and they get full creative AI behind closed doors. We have seen this before with sampling. Early hip hop could sample freely and the art form exploded. Then came lawsuits, and suddenly only people with money could do it. We are about to repeat that mistake. Meanwhile AI is actually good for normal musicians. Better demos. Arrangement help. Fast ideas. More releases. The real threat is not “some kid made a Suno track.” The real threat is that labels train on everything and then fire the ghostwriters and session people they replaced real bands with in the first place. Also notice how they frame it. They mix together style learning, which is normal, voice cloning, which is a real concern, and straight copyright infringement, which is already illegal, and then they say “all AI music is bad.” What they actually want is a world where learning from music is legal for humans but illegal for your tools. If we were serious about protecting musicians and keeping creativity open, we would push for training compensation pools, anti impersonation rules and open models, not corporate walled gardens. So yes, hate AI music if you want. Just do not help build a monopoly on creativity for the same industry that already swapped real bands for ghostwriter pipelines.",0.082,0.828,0.09,-0.3903,neg

I am a public librarian. A huge part of my job involves buying library materials with tax-funded dollars. Choices are made according to our collection development policy, which among other things takes into consideration the reputation of an author and publisher. AI-gen content is intrinsically of no reputable value. AI-gen content is rapidly changing how myself and other librarians in my network purchase eBooks and eAudiobooks. If you look in my comment history, you'll see some information about Hoopla and reasons why some libraries are cancelling their subscriptions. A huge factor is the amount of AI-gen content, or suspected AI-gen content, that is added to hoopla without any consideration for its quality. However, this doesn't just affect digital content. AI content is popping up in all material formats. Where this affects authors and readers: hoopla, Overdrive, and libraries rely on publishers Disclosing what AI is used in the creation of a product. Publishers, especially small publishers, don't always want to disclose this information. Librarians handle an incredible volume of ordering and do not have time to scrutinize every page of every book to look for AI-gen content. To simplify, an increasing number of us are building lists of disreputable publishers and simply not buying from them at all. This means that authors like Katee Roberts who publish through Draft2Digital might be caught up in this block. What you can do about it: - Don't buy AI. Pay someone real money for real creative labor. - Don't use AI. Smarter people than I have outlined how unethical it is. As a wise person once told me: ""Everyone has skills. [This] isn't one of yours."" Develop your own strengths. - Pressure publishers and authors to label AI-gen content and tools used in an item's creation. - Use your library's ""Suggest a Purchase"" feature if they don't have something you want.

I skimmed a bit, this reads like your first script so I will assume such. Im going to be kind but blunt. Scenes are confusing across the board, I rarely know where a specific character is within a scene, there are also little to no scene descriptors so I cant really visualize much. You throw a ton of stuff at the reader off the bat and dont explain any of it. Wtf is blackroot, is it an animal? A machine? Also submarines dont have sails, unless its a specific part of the submarine? If so make it clear that its not a sail in the sense of a sail boat. Basiclly everything before we get to Maya would end up forgotten because its so confusing. Don't use Chat. There are a few lines that stink of chat gpt. ""The machine moves like a predator that forgot it was built."" What does that even mean? If you didnt use GPT I do truly apologize but it seems unlikely. The concept itself isnt terrible. From what I gathered maya and her friends will end up trapped and the world will be in their hands. I like the idea but I wonder how much can be. I think beryl needs a better reason to start killing everyone though, it would make more sense for it to take out military infrastructure so the means of war are removed but if the goal is peace killing all people seems backwards. Who is the peace for then? Why are 4 cadets left alone on a live submarine with active weapons? They need a good reason. Maya is shallow as a character, her arc doesnt have any memorable moments and she is pretty reactive instead of moving the story along. Tons of dialogue that is pure exposition, show dont tell. Capitan lane has potential and is your best character personally, but the topic switchs to fast. Her death is basiclly forgotten. Lastly it feels like there is little resolution. The third act is the weakest. The switch from control to killing feels unwarranted and we jump from chaos to chaos and in the end the heroics dont feel earned. Just a ton of spectacle. Give it real emotion besides not wanting to die. Now with that said, this has a good bit of commercial viablity especially in this day and age. If you take your time and really weave in some emotions and flesh out the characters you could have something pretty solid on your hands. My biggest tip is to get creative when giving the audience information/exposition. Dialogue is the worst way to do it. Sounds, actions, subtle scene descriptors or the way a characters taps their fingers are more subtle and allow the reader to gain the information without slowing the read down to deliver a lesson on AI. Again congrats on finishing, from your post history it seems like youve been at it for a while. Apologizes if I missed anything I did a skim. Peace and Love",0.132,0.673,0.195,0.9887,pos

From a client's perspective, AI can't do the most important thing, which is *help someone completely unfamiliar with making art figure out what they want*. AI won't ask questions to clarify, it won't offer sketches and iterations, and it has no skill or education to help it figure out how to fulfill a client's request in an ideally personalized way. It also won't be in value for long, even if the general population didn't hate it, because it's become more difficult to scrape new images, so it will never be able to change or improve its style, or come up with new ideas. By definition, AI has no creativity, and can't do anything to stand out from the crowd. I've played with it before, and it quickly fails when asked to supply something unusual or new. A human, when asked for something they don't know, can research and figure it out in a day or so. AI can't. AI will definitely take some jobs and have a bad impact on the art market, but I can't see it replacing humans for all but the most basic, generic stuff. If you're worried about it, work on your ability to draw a wide range of things. Work on your communication skills. Work on pushing styles and ideas nobody else does.

I worked for small indie game studios and for publishers and private clients. I mean doing commissions work . doing traditional work and digital as well . at first I was really frightened about ai creating art .. and yes I feel it as a threat but not because ai itself . but because how they all want to sell it . instead of a tool. as a replacement .. and its a good marketing tool ( inflate a balloon if u know what I mean) . Strictly from the job offers .. in my case. no I didn't saw it diminishing I do see its hard for starting artists .. like if a person wrote a story and want a cover art and this person is on a budget or don't have enough money to pay for good pro art .. he or she will fall into beginners or cassual artists (nothing wrong with it ) but. instead of going through the adventurous roads in search of an artists .. its more easy to go to an airport an make some quick art and voila! presto! .. the real threat I feel is in there areas like the over flood of art and artists this days everyone can get an iPad or a Chinese brand cintiq and do some art ( and some great one too ) .. social platforms offers to connect artists with another artists .. and I never understood this . why?? I mean an artists can find other art&artists very easy but the real deal is or could be to connect artists with a possible client .. with game studios with publishing co. game boards rol play rpg fantasy rpg etc.. clients who want her pet immortalized in a canvas .. or etc.. etc.. and social media platforms seems to try hard the other way .. and with a hook to get there. to be noticed you need to : '' insert here what instagram algorithm has planned''. if they say jump u jump .. and in the end you are a slave of some algorithm .. of course none is forcing you . :/ .. but still and on the other side the other threat I feel is the economy .. not in one particular country but globally .. of course art .games . fun stuff its not going anywhere but its the small /medium problems that were accumulating under the rug for quite some time .. big aa companies going mainstream .. studios hiring teh fun stuff yeah ... hiring artists just because .. etc etc.. and in the end its all about money . theres no risks just recipes for a product that can sell well . debt . taking debt .. loans .. and if u ask me I see a future a good one but in small or medium gaming co.. studios ,Publishers . oNce the mainstream is overflowed it takes some time to get things to its normal levels.. I also have a lot of doubts and one fo them was. are ai art ( say in their 2d picture /illustration selling it for 2 u$d peanuts ) or. making small vids or selling prints t-shirt designs .. books for coloring -for kids, is anything of that really selling ? can you make ai art and live selling it ? I don't have a definitive -written in stone -- answer but from the info I gathered I can say NO . I don't see it . My clients want original art. unique pieces .. not something generic fancy stylish that is overflowed everywhere and anywhere .. So I think yes u can make 2d for living but maybe there should be some adjustments to be made .. people kind of are seeking for a true meaningful connection this days .. so dong great art and showing you Can actually do it its not enough you need to connect with people .creating a story .. something like that .. so in a nutshell .. yes ai can be a threat but for art specifically ( in my case or how I see it ) .. I feel like its not only that but the economy one one side . and the market overflowed with all type of art including ai art ( or those dumb pseudo artists who take ai art and trace over it or just paint over it saying. ooh Im An a artists now look how amazing I am !!. yeeeaaaah ok no publisher would want to pay you good money for that. thats what I think . and of course IM open to other opinions . :)",0.075,0.786,0.14,0.995,pos

We can do this three ways, which always happen together: - Ensuring that the ‘client’, whether internal or external, understands how long a task is going to take. I have certainly been in situations where people have thrown unrealistic expectations on deliverables, and learned to listen to them, understand the project and what it requires, then tell them how long it will take, with an eye on other work you may have at the moment, before they get a chance to dictate the timeline. Sometimes they really are in a rush, but they will be super grateful when you push other work aside for them (only occasionally, you need to put your foot down too) - Become more than the creative output person. They are paying us to be creative, but that entails more than just pushing things around on a screen. We need to be strategic problem solvers as well. We need to become assets to the client that they can’t live without. This is how we overcome AI but that is a deeper conversation. We are a soundboard to bounce ideas off of. We are distillers of information who concentrate the slop they give us into copy, hierarchy, beauty and effectiveness. This is what they can’t do, and if you start doing it then they will respect what you do, and you become part of the team, valuable. This will also reduce the iterations you make as you’ll have a better idea of what is required, but you have to make sure from the start that you KNOW what is required. - Don’t let ourselves be abused. We are humans doing a difficult job. We need to be creative, but at the same time understand marketing, business goals, and be expert level multi taskers. It’s a lot and people need to understand that set of abilities is unusual and desired. The first person who needs to understand that is your boss. If they don’t respect what you do and refuse to listen, it’s time to move on to a new job, no more discussion . If they are open to your discussions with them, then have those discussions. If they aren’t a designer, teach them what it is we do. What it is we CAN do that will benefit the company should they let you stretch your wings. There is a reason we exist, and that is to make money for the company. That’s it. If we can enhance the brand or increase the awareness of a product, we’ve done our job. But we need the opportunity to influence those projects with our expertise. Also, repeating what others have said, not every project is do or die in terms of creativity. Pick your battles and so amazing work on the ones that mean something, and take it easy on the ones that don’t. You’re a human and can’t be stressed all the time. If it were me, I would put emphasis on the projects where they engage with me, and scale down my interest from there to the people who are using me.

The majority of people only interact with art when it hits them and they cannot avoid it. They don't know anything of artistic intention or the wider world of art as dissent. They see a cheap copy of something in a hotel lobby and something original and revolutionary in a museum as the same thing. AI ""art"" is the evolution of people who aren't interested in art as a whole who wouldn't have the drive or talent to produce something with their hands. Is it not art? Unless someone does something novel and innovative that only AI can do, then no it isn't. It's creative for them, and maybe for some it is a step into actually creating. However that being said I know a few people who are really talented painters, but all they can do is reproduce what they see. They cannot create anything evocative or profound on their own. There's a larger conversation about art and AI but the majority everyone will take is AI bad or haha woke art baby cry. AI is a tool like any other before it. There's less skill barrier to use at a base level, but there's potential for someone to leverage it in a profound and interesting way. We're going to have to wait and see.

AutoCAD, V-ray and Lumion are notable examples (they were easy to copy or had free versions for long time). After the user base (critical mass) is created, it depends on the intelligence of the management to device a way to exploit popularity for profit. For example, Adobe (oKay, never really free, but used to be very easy to copy) uses low subscription cost, for huge suites of software, which worked well for single pro users. Autodesk and Lumion failed because only large offices can afford them, or pros doing full time work, certainly not occasional users, so all those potential users are gone. Also, all people working in an office gets to install the software at home as well, since these days it’s all based on email accounts, so these type of prices are steeper. I see little chance for Affinity to really kill adobe, because everyone can get dozens of adobe software for few dollars per months. I mean, Affinity cannot play the cheap card, hence, they can only compete by doing free.

Writing in Spanish to tap into multiple countries is also a strong international SEO move, as it broadens your potential audience beyond a single market. Integrating social media channels like Instagram and Twitter to funnel traffic to your blog is practical, but keep in mind that current user behavior favors short, highly engaging video formats, TikTok and Reels, for example. Since you’re already aware of that, consider complementing your carousels with short videos or interactive content to better capture attention on those platforms. One thing to watch closely is how you adapt your content for AI-driven search results. With emerging generative search experiences, content that directly answers user intents and leverages entity-based semantics tends to perform better. Structured data is a good start, but also ensure your content is framed in a way that AI can easily understand and extract value from.

Ensure the resume format is an easy to parse structure (Limit tables, limit complex formatting). This gets you at the top of the list. * Stage 2: The 5 Second Test. Does your resume stand out after only 5 seconds. That means good ordering, easy to read, appropriate font size, etc. This gets you into the first pile. * Stage 3: The 1 Minute Test.

Is it a list of skills and duties, or actual ways you pushed initiatives and improved company outlook. * Stage 4: The Next Day Test.

That’s augmentation. Replacement – the idea that AI could take over your entire job – would require what’s called **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**. AGI would mean an AI that can do *any intellectual task* a human can, not just specialized pattern recognition or language generation. If we had true AGI, it could learn to drive a car with 20 hours of practice like a teenager, or independently complete a PhD-level research project. We’re nowhere near that.

What are not losing value & in fact getting more values are below - 1. Understanding a business problem & converting it to a scientific problem that can be programmed. 2. Capacity of writing step by step algorithm & feed each step to AI model to get codes. This is where junior folks are losing jobs as they used to do a lot of this mundane coding from already written algorithms (I'm not talking about the top 1-2% genius who can do wonders as freshers). 3. Validate the code via a different bot. Automated unit test. (This is where junior folks are invested now) Key challenge - AI gives a lot of garbage.

"" major Workday lawsuit, Mobley v. Workday, Inc., alleges the company's AI-powered applicant screening tools discriminate against older, minority, and disabled job applicants by creating a ""disparate impact"". The case is proceeding as a nationwide collective action, with the court granting conditional certification for claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) after Workday's motion to dismiss was denied. This means the lawsuit can move forward on behalf of potentially millions of applicants aged 40 and over who have been denied employment through systems using Workday's AI. Key details of the lawsuit Plaintiffs' claims: The lawsuit alleges that Workday's AI tools, used by employers to screen and rank candidates, unfairly penalize older applicants and reflect biases present in the training data. Legal basis: The case argues that Workday can be held liable as an ""agent"" of the employers using its software, and that the AI's process results in systemic discrimination through a ""disparate impact"" on protected classes. Workday's defense: Workday has argued that its tools do not provide ""employment recommendations"" and that the proposed collective is not similarly situated. Court's decisions: The court denied Workday's second motion to dismiss, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The court conditionally certified the ADEA claims, allowing the case to proceed as a nationwide collective action on behalf of applicants 40 and older. Broader implications: The case is being closely watched as it raises significant questions about the legal liability of AI vendors for discriminatory outcomes produced by their software and highlights the need for bias audits and human oversight in AI-driven hiring processes.

Think of it like having a professional proofreader or resume coach. It just helps your accomplishments read clearly and concisely. The tricky part is that some AI detectors look at style, phrasing, or patterns that are typical of AI-generated text. So if your resume sounds “too polished” or formulaic, it might get flagged even if it’s accurate. A few ways to balance this is to keep your voice. After AI helps polish your resume, read it aloud and tweak any phrasing so it feels natural to how you would actually describe your experience. Add specific, personal details afterwards too. Quantifiable achievements, project names, tools you used, and context make it clear that the experience is yours. The main thing is to use AI as a tool, not a writer.

I have a rule for this type of shenanigans: *give them what they want.* Here’s why: 1. I refuse to lose myself and get bothered by a parent. Their initial reaction and subsequent requests are unreasonable and illogical so I cannot win any argument with logic. 2. Admin will never get mad if you give a parent what they want even if it’s unreasonable. They simply won’t. In fact, they’ll probably praise you. Everytime I’ve given in to an unreasonable request they were aware of, they’ve actually thanked me for “being flexible.” 3. The person who ultimately loses in any scenario where a parent and teacher have a disagreement is the student. This is actually really sad given ai teach to help young people. But the thing is, if they have a parent that makes unreasonable requests, they lost a long time ago and will continue to lose. There’s little I can do to stop that, actually. Therefore, it’s not worth the effort on my part to change their pov. Here’s a dramatized interaction I had with a parent so you can see how this works: Parent: my child worked so hard on this project. They skipped practices and missed a family birthday party to complete it. I know it was due three months ago, it’s only half completed, and it wasn’t even completed using the novel we read, but you’re being completely unreasonable if you think this deserves anything less than an A. Look, she even drew a doodle on the cover page and colored it mostly within the lines! Me: Ok. She gets an A. BOOM. That’s it. It’s maybe the easiest part of the job. You might be thinking *how could he do that*? Well, grades mean absolutely nothing. We use them as messages to other institutions to depict our best guess of a students ability and intelligence. But they aren’t magic. Me assigning an A doesn’t make the student smarter or more able. This is what parents seem to believe. But if you think asking for an A is going to make your kid a better person, you’re wrong. So I refuse to get ruffled. The damage is already done even before the parent makes the request. This attitude is surely the family’s *modus operandi* and my pushback won’t change it. I just save tons of time and frustration. I save convos with admin about why they got a low grade. I save all the parent convos and meetings.

The first is essentially an ever-escalating war of cheat detection. There is software that the school can require students use that logs every key stroke and evaluates the naturalness of the way its written so copy/pasting from AI written material is caught. There's also test taking software that will lock down a computer and prevents any other app from being used at the same and will watch them through the laptop webcam. There's also the classic that many others recommended of having them hand-write in class time and that doesnt require licensing the software.

You need an answer to that question and the answer needs to be something you can demonstrate. That means teaching the limitations of AI, like how you can tell AI is used a lot of the time because it will usually produce something that sounds *wrong* and can even lie or make things up. So teaching why AI produced material often sounds wrong or comes out as spiraling mess is important. But the lesson cant stop there or youre doing a disservice. You need to be candid about how AI can be prompted to give better responses that sound more natural. And teaching how to use AI as a shortcut, but then edit the responses it gives and double check anything AI asserts as fact. For better or worse this is a writing tool they are *going* to be using for the rest of their lives. They should be equipped with how to use it *well*. You've got part of the answer already with the changes youre making to your rubric. The next part is teaching them why your rubric is what it is and how you would use the rubric to grade a paper. Show them live in class what kind of paper AI generates with the basic prompting that your laziest sudents are bound to give it. Show them how garbage-in results in garbage-out. Show them how to prompt the AI better for something that isn't garbage but still needs edits. And show them live in class how and why you would edit it. Straight up tell your students you expect them all to use AI on their home assignments but you also expect them to either figure out the perfect series of prompts that no further edits are required or for them to take the AI generated material and personally edit it to make sure it conforms to the rubric.

What I have noticed working the most is uncertainty about whether they’re being flagged for AI. So, I told him that I will not be giving anyone a zero for AI at all. AI is not something I can grade on. The only thing I can grade on is if they are knowingly cheating, or if their papers don’t make criteria. If the paper meets criteria in all the ways I’ve asked for, then it gets credit. However, if I suspect a paper of AI, that’s because it does something wrong in a very weird way. So, I tell them that when I suspect a paper of AI, I will never accuse that person of using AI. I will, however, ding them for every other possible thing I can think of or find something that I say is ungradeable about it where I have to get a complete resubmission and a rewrite because of some aspect of it that makes it completely off-topic. I will do this over and over again with the student, giving them zeros (or very, very low grades) and having them resubmit and giving them feedback where the only thing it seems like they can do is completely rewrite the paper and they will eventually give up and stop trying. Some of them get a zero for their AI essay and never try again. What they are going to try to do is just quit your class and take a different teacher in another semester to try to still use the method they want to use to get around it. You can spend time worrying about it, or you can realize that them using AI has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them… that what’s going on in their life and their life decisions have nothing to do with you and neither are personal to your class your expectations or you as a person. It’s not so much that they wanna fuck around and find out, it’s that they live in a world where they are told that things are a certain way so often, when they absolutely are not, that they distrust anybody telling them that something is one way or will work a certain way. So, you saying “you won’t get away with AI “or letting them know what the policy is?…that doesn’t matter. There are kids out there that smoke pot and do drugs and hold down 40-hour-a-week jobs at the same time or who are used to dealing with bosses that claim to be super smart who aren’t. They will not respect us or understand what we know just because we told them we have a policy or a claim that we can do something. They’re used to people bullshitting them on that stuff all the time. So, they are fucking around and finding out because the greatest way to learn the truth these days is to fuck around (develop a hypothesis, develop methods for gathering data to answer the hypothesis, gather the data relevant to answering the hypothesis) and find out (analyze the data relevant to answering the hypothesis, and concluding to what degree the hypothesis was true or false and if any other information can be determined). In a world full of social media algorithms and ads they can’t afford to block and AI convincing the parents they’ve looked up to their whole lives that “somebody is actually eating the cats and dogs in that one town because I just saw a news story about it where the people were actually eating the cats and dogs on video on the news, honey…it’s not fake, it’s real!”, what else is there to do? Fucking around and finding out is the only way to deduce the truth now. It’s somewhat ironic that we may be in classrooms, teaching them how to do valid studies and find credible data and when they don’t trust us and end up testing us instead we find that to be confusing. I actually find great comfort in this. It means that even when we don’t follow the advice of our own content areas without realizing it, and the students don’t care about the advice within our own content areas either, the purpose of our content still manages to be achieved by the systems that we have in place for determining credibility through discoveries made about how to officially gather data over human history. The teachings and conflicts between Protagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Descartes, Derrida, etc etc…these are all built into our current systems even if we don’t live by it on a minute-to-minute basis.

Each writing assignment now requires them to submit three potential topics of interest with a potential thesis sentence for each and a reason tied to class why the topic interests them. I offer them feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of each. Once they choose, they must physically submit a handwritten mind map on their selection that includes both potential research they'd like to use and connections to specific slides/discussions from our lectures. Then, they submit a more traditional outline with topic sentences and evidence. Then, a rough draft that they peer review in class. And last they submit a physical copy of their final draft with specific pieces underlined, highlighted, or circled. The rubric includes points for each of these steps, and the final paper is worth only a little more than the previous steps (to ensure they do all of them). It's a much longer process and means we can't do as many small writing assignments, but it requires a lot more engagement from them to keep consistent (and explain major changes) and I've found much less blatant AI copy and paste. Even if they use AI, the need to print their papers and highlight certain things necessitates that they at least read the thing before I have to.

Dead serious, I ran into the exact thing applying for grad school - ran my statement through a ton of detectors and would end up with random percentages like 10% here, 30% there, even on the same text, just depending on the checker. Super annoying. I noticed words like ""systemic inequities"" and ""environmental risks"" also trigger some detectors, probably 'cause they think it's too formal or not chatty enough. Ugh, sucks you gotta second-guess your own style when it’s what gets you noticed in clinical psych! If you haven’t used AI and your story is legit, one bogus percentage on ZeroGPT won’t kill your app. I did recently use AIDetectPlus for my SOP - what’s cool is it doesn’t just give you a dumb number, it breaks down which parts look bot-like and why, so you actually know what’s tripping the detector. I used that and Copyleaks side by side to cross-check. It helped me reword just a couple lines instead of the whole thing, and honestly, my style stayed mine. Honestly, grad schools aren’t rejecting strong, personal writing over one low flag. You’ve got months of work in that thing - don’t let the tech make you rewrite who you are.

Hitting a growth plateau on Instagram incredibly frustrating, especially when you feel like you're doing everything right. It's a wall almost every business account hits. Regarding services like Crowd ignite, I'd advise caution. The core issue with many ""visibility"" services is the quality of the engagement. They can sometimes lead to a spike in vanity metrics (likes, follows) from bots or accounts that will never become customers, which can actually hurt your account's standing with the algorithm in the long run. The algorithm prioritizes genuine engagement. Staying organic is powerful, but ""just keep grinding"" isn't a strategy. You need a strategic grind. Before you consider spending money on any kind of promotion, I'd recommend running a quick audit on your current strategy. Often, a few small tweaks can reignite growth. Here’s a simple ""Plateau-Breaker"" checklist you can use: The 3-Second Bio Audit: Look at your profile. Can a brand new visitor understand who you are, who you help, and what they should do next within three seconds? Your profile picture, username, and the first line of your bio need to do all the heavy lifting. If it’s not crystal clear, that’s your first fix. Refine Your Content Pillars: You mentioned posting ""good content,"" which is great! But is it structured? All your content should fall into 3-4 ""pillars."" For a small business, these are often: Educate: Teach your audience something related to your product/industry (e.g., a coffee shop shows how to make the perfect latte at home). Entertain: Use humor, trends, or satisfying visuals that are relevant to your niche. This is where Reels using trending audio shine. Connect: Show the human side of your business. Behind-the-scenes, introduce the owner, share a customer story, talk about your ""why."" This builds community. Promote: This should be the smallest pillar. It’s the direct ""buy our stuff"" post. Aim for an 80/20 or 90/10 split of value to promotion. Implement a Proactive Engagement Strategy: Instead of just responding to comments, spend 15 minutes before and after you post actively engaging outwards. Go to the profiles of your ideal customers or complementary businesses and leave genuine, thoughtful comments on their posts. This puts you on their radar in an authentic way. Boost Your Winners, Don't Polish Your Duds: Once you have a post that performs exceptionally well organically, that's the one to put a small ad spend behind. Use Instagram's own ""Boost Post"" feature to show it to a ""Lookalike Audience"" of your current followers. You're not trying to make a bad post good; you're showing a proven, great post to more of the right people. The algorithm hasn't lost interest in you; it's just waiting for a new signal that your content is resonating deeply. By refining your strategy, you can give it exactly the signals it's looking for. Hope this helps give you a few new ideas to try! TL;DR: Avoid sketchy growth services. Before paying for anything, refine your strategy. Make your bio crystal clear, structure your posts into Educate/Entertain/Connect pillars, engage with ideal customers proactively, and only use Instagram's official ads to boost your best-performing organic content.",0.038,0.756,0.206,0.9987,pos

I have a couple of tips - most of the time, organic traction comes from air cover marketing/providing value and entertainment rather than direct response/salesy content. The algorithm is constantly changing, and so what worked a month ago may not still work now. Iteration is part of the game, and people who stay stagnant tend to fall off pretty quickly. Also, not sure if you're doing this already but personal brand/face lead content actually helps a lot, especially if you're B2C. People like it when they can know and rally behind a person, not just a brand. Also, not actually familiar with Crowd Ignite, but I don't think there's anything wrong with some paid traffic, as long as avg. customer LTV allows it, e.g. ads that drive traffic to your page/capture leads/drive more foot traffic when avg LTV is $20 shouldn't cost you more than $5/result, but if you have some sort of subscription, or in general good retention, paid ads can be a cheat code, especially with a local market.

To your question about one bot vs. multiple: in most cases, it’s easier (and more scalable) to start with one central bot that’s connected to a well-structured knowledge base. You can always expand it later by topic or department if it gets too large. The key is how you organize and maintain your content, not how many bots you have. If you’re already using HubSpot (even lightly), there’s actually a good foundation there: You can host all your SOPs, product documentation, and FAQs in the HubSpot Knowledge Base (part of the Service Hub). Then use HubSpot’s Chatbot Builder (and soon, more AI-driven tools) to serve that content in conversational form, internally or even on your site for customers. Everything stays in one system, so as your data grows, you’re not duplicating info across multiple platforms. For something more custom — like training a bot on historical product data or internal docs — a HubSpot Solutions Partner could be a great fit. They can do the heavy lifting: building out the knowledge structure, connecting data sources, and even designing the conversational flows. You can find vetted partners here who specialize in AI and automation projects like this: If you’re just exploring and want to talk through what’s possible first, I’d suggest chatting with a HubSpot Solutions Partner — they’ll help you scope it without locking you into a tool before you’re ready. Totally get where you’re coming from, you want something that just works, not another DIY project. You’re definitely on the right track! \-Cassie @ Hubspot",0.0,0.862,0.138,0.9889,pos

For example, we built a lead routing system that parses form fills, enriches data via API, scores the lead, and sends it to the right rep, all without human input. Same with a customer support agent that triages tickets based on tone and urgency before a human ever sees it. Also if you’re helping others, templates and naming conventions matter way more than we expected.

With the right guidance, you could absolutely put enough information in, and the right prompt, to get something out that is better than you could produce yourself, both in how it reads, and the actual quality of the plan. The issue is, if you don't know how to put a business plan together, then you don't know what to feed into an Ai tool to get a decent business plan back out. And if you've not seen a good business plan before, then you have no idea if what's coming out is good or not (and to an untrained eye, it will seem good...especially when it wraps up the presentation of the plan with questions about what to get out of it next).",0.028,0.833,0.14,0.9846,pos

Pick one segment, either go after independent hotels under 50 rooms who need basic automation, or partner with a hospitality consultant who already has relationships with chains and can vouch for you.

Now Universal and Udio are targeting 2026 for the launch of their joint platform, which will be a “walled garden” where no AI creations can be downloaded or posted outside of the site. The idea, according to UMG executive vice president and chief digital officer Michael Nash, is to avoid “direct cannibalization,” preventing the AI songs from competing with artists’ actual tracks on streaming, and making sure the platform generates entirely new revenue. Users will only be able to work with songs whose creators have opted in, which will limit the available catalog, perhaps vastly so. But Universal is confident that there is some interest from artists. “From our preliminary conversations as we extend the outreach,” says Nash, “there are artists that are not gonna want to be the first wave of product introduction. And there are artists that are definitely going to want to be part of the first wave.” Their pitch to artists is, he adds, “You’ll have enormous control over the parameters around that interaction, and then you will have significant economic participation. As opposed to the current world in which there’s no control and there’s very little economic participation, it’s a pretty attractive proposition.” \---- Basically, this will let Udio users play with a much smaller collection of music, from artists who opt in, and none of what those AI-using wannabe artists generate can be streamed anywhere but Udio. It'll be an online playroom. Current Udio users are already complaining. Current users had their ability to download tracks already generated cut off, which really had them screaming. They will have a limited time starting Monday to download those previously generated tracks, but will be unable to download any new tracks they generate. I would like to see generative AI companies sued out of existence, period, with their owners and executives prosecuted for the IP theft, and already-trained AI models destroyed.
