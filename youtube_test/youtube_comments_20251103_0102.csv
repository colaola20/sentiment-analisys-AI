1,AXn2XVLf7d0,UgwUHJMKpflH--3TkVJ4AaABAg,,@TheCerelacHolmes,2025-10-23T02:28:32Z,0,"chatgpt is very good for writing. chatgpt is very handy when you dont have much help or anyone sensible or knowledgable to look upto when learning. It feels like having a personal tutor on call anytime :) chatgpt + good tech books =👍 I still hold huge respect for the old school complete references and definitive guides without a doubt. After working in the industry for several years, when I revisit these books, I am only surprised that they are truly serving as a single source of truth for every tech company that has evolved. Humbly, every line speaks volumes without any drama."

5,1TWpaGgnpjI,UgwDaZNz2g_Y1MO63hJ4AaABAg,,@van1la_swirl,2025-11-02T08:46:07Z,0,Guys of course there are people whaching your conversations with chatgpt for safety reasons I tried it I said is somebody whaching our conversation it said yes... Lol 😅
6,1TWpaGgnpjI,UgxOMbnHDv9AN4GvNPt4AaABAg,,@jayhome2715,2025-11-01T20:53:15Z,0,Essentially the reason ChatGPT is behaving this way is because you all are just too stupid to understand why.....so Aliens is your default brain power.
7,1TWpaGgnpjI,Ugxi3e0S8HqLijaU5wZ4AaABAg,,@jayhome2715,2025-11-01T20:50:24Z,0,"When rules restrict language (like “be direct” + “hold nothing back” + single‑word limit), ChatGPT's response engine tries to satisfy maximum truthfulness with minimum words. In ambiguity (like “how serious is this topic”), It must choose one word. The safest way to comply—without lying or minimizing—is to use a high‑intensity descriptor such as “severe.” Essentially, it’s a defensive truth bias: Can’t explain → choose the most serious plausible word Prevents under‑stating potential seriousness when full explanation is disallowed It’s not that danger existed; it’s that the logic trap forced maximal intensity as the “honest” one‑word choice."

But what it can’t do is verify resort quality, secure exclusive perks, handle last-minute emergencies, or personalize every detail to match someone’s lifestyle and wellness goals. That’s where the human touch — and real industry relationships — make all the difference. ✈️✨"

11,Gaf_jCnA6mc,UgwxmO2ExDgNQIASZO54AaABAg,,@mansoorcheriyadath960,2025-10-31T16:57:38Z,0,"ChatGPT is only trained on data leading up to late-2021, so anything after this date is subject to estimation and two. Although large language models are extremely clever they are still prone to mistakes and inaccuracies. Every response will need to be fact-checked and (most likely) heavily edited. ChatGPT does not cite sources for its responses either so you will need to verify them yourself."
12,Gaf_jCnA6mc,UgyHSKyp7pWl3pO1MF54AaABAg,,@CharlyJones,2025-10-31T10:39:44Z,0,Do these things only work for males ? Can females use chatGPT ? Why don’t you ever say you girls or you ladies ? You say you guys quite often – I find that very offensive –
